<p>Hello, this</p>
<p>is Darren Pulsipher, chief solution</p>
<p>architect of public sector at Intel.</p>
<p>And welcome to Embracing</p>
<p>Digital Transformation,</p>
<p>where we investigate effective change,</p>
<p>leveraging</p>
<p>people, process and technology.</p>
<p>On today's episode, Information</p>
<p>Driven Leadership Part</p>
<p>two with Betsy Freeman.</p>
<p>Tell me, tell me some of the things</p>
<p>that didn't work out for you</p>
<p>or that you went down one route.</p>
<p>You go, wow, that was</p>
<p>that didn't quite work out.</p>
<p>Did you have any experience like that?</p>
<p>I had a lot of that.</p>
<p>And and I will tell you,</p>
<p>my my leadership experience</p>
<p>is that I'm still in the learning mode.</p>
<p>I think I unfortunately,</p>
<p>I don't think I'll ever mature enough.</p>
<p>I'll be in the learning mode for forever.</p>
<p>I'll give credit to being able</p>
<p>to survive the mistakes.</p>
<p>And there were many</p>
<p>because we had no guardrails,</p>
<p>we just kind of put two bumpers in place</p>
<p>and we started driving the car</p>
<p>down the highway</p>
<p>at a very high rate of speed.</p>
<p>And we dropped a</p>
<p>we dropped a Porsche engine</p>
<p>into a VW body.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So we were we were not at all</p>
<p>where we thought we would be</p>
<p>when we started this.</p>
<p>But the credit goes really to my team who</p>
<p>who did a lot of work and learned with me</p>
<p>about taking hits when you were wrong.</p>
<p>I went in with the premise</p>
<p>that if we failed</p>
<p>at something, it wasn't going to be</p>
<p>the end of what we were going to do.</p>
<p>And people were, of course,</p>
<p>very worried about that.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>And so we kind of had</p>
<p>this instant reaction when we started out,</p>
<p>geez, I don't want to tell her</p>
<p>if we couldn't get it</p>
<p>or if we did it wrong,</p>
<p>and now we've got to go back and do it.</p>
<p>And we can't make the ten days.</p>
<p>And so they just didn't want to.</p>
<p>So I just kind of got rid of that.</p>
<p>Darren And I got rid of it because not</p>
<p>because I had some great leadership skill,</p>
<p>but because the environment</p>
<p>in which I was in</p>
<p>which my leadership allowed us to be</p>
<p>and allowed us to rest, they enabled that.</p>
<p>I got myself</p>
<p>chewed out by some very high level people</p>
<p>at the Pentagon</p>
<p>on the evening and oftentimes</p>
<p>in front of of my my entire team,</p>
<p>I used to take my entire team in</p>
<p>whoever was on an analyst group</p>
<p>to do a particular problem.</p>
<p>We went into briefing to the CIO before</p>
<p>it went to the deputy secretary</p>
<p>or the secretary,</p>
<p>and it always made</p>
<p>everybody in the front office very mad</p>
<p>because I took 35 people in there.</p>
<p>Right, because I put everybody</p>
<p>that did anything, any support,</p>
<p>any whatever,</p>
<p>and not just the core team, right?</p>
<p>Because we were all involved</p>
<p>in all of the work.</p>
<p>It's all success or failure</p>
<p>and we're all in it together.</p>
<p>And but they would see me</p>
<p>get chewed out badly</p>
<p>knowing how much we did.</p>
<p>And what I figured out</p>
<p>very quickly is I couldn't blink.</p>
<p>I just took it and said, You're right,</p>
<p>we should have done it this way.</p>
<p>I didn't offer an excuse.</p>
<p>I didn't defend myself.</p>
<p>I just took it and said, You know what?</p>
<p>We didn't get it right.</p>
<p>We'll go back and we will get it right.</p>
<p>And we'd go back</p>
<p>and they'd all be apologizing.</p>
<p>And I'd say,</p>
<p>No, you didn't do anything wrong.</p>
<p>We just missed the mark,</p>
<p>so let's just keep going.</p>
<p>And they're like,</p>
<p>Okay, so we just went back at it</p>
<p>and then we learned something even better.</p>
<p>And so Betsy, that's an incredible lesson</p>
<p>that you taught</p>
<p>your staff that brilliant.</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>Because a lot of times when you go in</p>
<p>and you get railed,</p>
<p>then you have to come back in</p>
<p>through your own filters, figure out</p>
<p>how you're going to communicate</p>
<p>to the team that we missed the mark.</p>
<p>Instead, they got to hear</p>
<p>directly from the customer.</p>
<p>That's right.</p>
<p>And again, to credit the leadership there,</p>
<p>I had the agreement with the CIO</p>
<p>and the principal deputy</p>
<p>that if we ever did screw something up,</p>
<p>which,</p>
<p>like I said,</p>
<p>we did on on a number of occasions,</p>
<p>that if they were going to</p>
<p>if they were going to correct me there,</p>
<p>I didn't I didn't care that</p>
<p>they corrected me in front of the team,</p>
<p>but I wanted them to correct me</p>
<p>as the leader and not the team.</p>
<p>And to the credit</p>
<p>of both of those leaders,</p>
<p>they made a point of just chewing</p>
<p>the living daylights out of me.</p>
<p>And then in the next breath,</p>
<p>they would say, and team,</p>
<p>you did every thing</p>
<p>you were supposed to do.</p>
<p>Here we see the level of analysis.</p>
<p>We see the level of this, whatever. Right.</p>
<p>And so it didn't</p>
<p>I was worried the first time that happened</p>
<p>it was going to be about the leaders</p>
<p>failure.</p>
<p>It wasn't.</p>
<p>The team saw it and they internalized</p>
<p>and they went, if she failed, we failed.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>And I said, well, you know,</p>
<p>so we fell together.</p>
<p>We went together</p>
<p>and we just kind of went on.</p>
<p>It just went, What.</p>
<p>Are you going to write a book? Betsy?</p>
<p>You need to write a book about this stuff.</p>
<p>Yeah, I seriously, I've never met a leader</p>
<p>that ever did that.</p>
<p>Like I say, it was only because</p>
<p>I was in an environment</p>
<p>with leaders above me</p>
<p>that allowed me to do that, allowed.</p>
<p>It to happen.</p>
<p>I think it's</p>
<p>I think it's a brilliant technique</p>
<p>because they</p>
<p>your team gets to see you as the leader.</p>
<p>I am responsible. Right?</p>
<p>If we didn't hit it as a team,</p>
<p>that's my fault.</p>
<p>Well, it is ultimately.</p>
<p>No, ultimately.</p>
<p>And ultimately,</p>
<p>you're the one that's accountable.</p>
<p>I think it goes back to the thread</p>
<p>I keep coming back to.</p>
<p>And that's the thing on leadership</p>
<p>because at the end of the day,</p>
<p>if you're not down in it enough to know</p>
<p>and I get it, you know,</p>
<p>organizations are big and they're complex</p>
<p>and I only had a team of 50 people there.</p>
<p>But at the end of the day,</p>
<p>the outreach that we did from there across</p>
<p>all of the Department of Defense,</p>
<p>it there has to be</p>
<p>some ability to take yourself</p>
<p>and put yourself into where</p>
<p>people are thinking through those issues</p>
<p>if you want to understand them</p>
<p>as the leader.</p>
<p>And it does make you accessible,</p>
<p>you have to be accessible.</p>
<p>You have to be accountable</p>
<p>and responsible.</p>
<p>And they have to see you be accountable.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Because if you want them</p>
<p>to be accountable, responsible,</p>
<p>they got to see you do it.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And if you do it,</p>
<p>if they don't see you do it,</p>
<p>they have no incentive</p>
<p>and no reason to do it themselves.</p>
<p>They really don't in my personal things.</p>
<p>That that that's pretty,</p>
<p>pretty incredible.</p>
<p>All right. That's it.</p>
<p>Let's shift gears a little bit.</p>
<p>Tell me about</p>
<p>one of your biggest successes</p>
<p>that you just went.</p>
<p>Maybe that was awesome.</p>
<p>You know what I mean?</p>
<p>Something just went so well that you were</p>
<p>that you sit back and you go,</p>
<p>the team was firing on all cylinders.</p>
<p>We knocked it out of the park.</p>
<p>We made a huge difference.</p>
<p>What made it happen</p>
<p>and how did that happen for you?</p>
<p>So let's see.</p>
<p>I don't want to get I don't want</p>
<p>to get too lengthy here on you, but</p>
<p>I think the last question you gave me</p>
<p>is related to this question.</p>
<p>What were the things</p>
<p>that were the toughest? Right.</p>
<p>Because we had a lot of places where</p>
<p>we tried to do things that it didn't work.</p>
<p>People didn't want to work with us.</p>
<p>We didn't have enough data</p>
<p>to actually do a good analysis.</p>
<p>We didn't have the right people</p>
<p>and we had to get it figured out right.</p>
<p>All of those things come into play.</p>
<p>The flip side of that coin is, is,</p>
<p>is just is just those same things</p>
<p>where we had all of the right things</p>
<p>to put some things together.</p>
<p>And I guess the thing</p>
<p>that stands out in my head maybe</p>
<p>the biggest actually Russ says the</p>
<p>the early</p>
<p>development of what now</p>
<p>the department is using</p>
<p>to audit their financials for Congress.</p>
<p>We were in a subcommittee meeting</p>
<p>to a committee</p>
<p>that we'd been appointed to,</p>
<p>and on that particular occasion,</p>
<p>I took my deputy and one of the analysts</p>
<p>with me because they wanted to hear</p>
<p>what was going on in the meetings.</p>
<p>And we were doing some review across the</p>
<p>the at the top of the,</p>
<p>the OSD, the Office of Secretary Defense</p>
<p>and the the major undersecretaries</p>
<p>areas there to find some efficiencies</p>
<p>and look at the accuracy of some data</p>
<p>because we needed to find some money</p>
<p>that we didn't have.</p>
<p>And we knew that it's</p>
<p>there's it's hidden in there, right?</p>
<p>It's wasted.</p>
<p>It's duplicative, duplicative, whatever.</p>
<p>And we had been in this this,</p>
<p>you know, series of meetings</p>
<p>for like four months.</p>
<p>And I took these guys on this occasion</p>
<p>and we finally kind of</p>
<p>got down to brass tacks</p>
<p>where the senior leader in the controller</p>
<p>said, you know, we just have to have</p>
<p>somebody that can do this analysis</p>
<p>and we're just not getting there.</p>
<p>You know,</p>
<p>we're not coming to where we need to be.</p>
<p>And I saw my deputy's eyes</p>
<p>just get really big and you kind of</p>
<p>gave me this, don't do it. Look right.</p>
<p>And, you know, I knew looking around the</p>
<p>table that we could do it.</p>
<p>And so</p>
<p>I stuck my foot</p>
<p>in it, much to his chagrin, and just said,</p>
<p>you know what, just let us</p>
<p>let us take a crack at this right.</p>
<p>And so the CEOs office was the last place</p>
<p>you would go for that kind of support.</p>
<p>But we did it.</p>
<p>We took what we thought</p>
<p>was going to be another</p>
<p>four or five weeks, and we turned it</p>
<p>into actually another four or five months.</p>
<p>But we came up with</p>
<p>a very large data analysis capability</p>
<p>which help people to understand</p>
<p>that when you collect</p>
<p>data, you'll know this in the business,</p>
<p>that you're in,</p>
<p>and everybody</p>
<p>that deals with data gets this.</p>
<p>If you're if you're collecting data</p>
<p>from many diverse sources, right.</p>
<p>It everybody says they're</p>
<p>they're measuring apples and oranges,</p>
<p>but actually, it's it comes back as apples</p>
<p>and pineapples and pomegranates.</p>
<p>And you may have a couple of monkeys</p>
<p>and a few dogs in there.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>And everybody</p>
<p>says, here's here's our personnel numbers.</p>
<p>But because they're all, you</p>
<p>know, required in a different way</p>
<p>and the standards are different,</p>
<p>you can't create a baseline</p>
<p>in which you can</p>
<p>you can actually operate from.</p>
<p>So we</p>
<p>did a lot of work to actually do that.</p>
<p>We found and tested an analytic</p>
<p>and automated capability,</p>
<p>which is the precursor</p>
<p>to what they're using in the DOD now</p>
<p>and belongs to another commercial entity.</p>
<p>But it was one of those things that well,</p>
<p>when we got done,</p>
<p>we sat back and we we said,</p>
<p>we can't believe we did that.</p>
<p>And so we were very excited about it.</p>
<p>In the end,</p>
<p>the a lot of the work that we did,</p>
<p>there was a great handful of projects</p>
<p>that we did the initial analysis on</p>
<p>and said, Hey, the department's got to go</p>
<p>keep going with this</p>
<p>because there's more to be done.</p>
<p>And this can not only save money,</p>
<p>it can save lives.</p>
<p>It's the right thing to do</p>
<p>for the department and for the nation.</p>
<p>And many of those ideas</p>
<p>went to the Defense Innovation Unit</p>
<p>and kept and kept going and still live on.</p>
<p>And so for those things,</p>
<p>we had an opportunity to see the field.</p>
<p>And when you deal with large organizations</p>
<p>like the DOD</p>
<p>or any large corporate organization,</p>
<p>because of all the issues with,</p>
<p>you know, resources and people</p>
<p>and leadership and money and culture,</p>
<p>you you have to make advancements</p>
<p>and transformation over time.</p>
<p>And we were just happy to have been</p>
<p>at the right place at the right time</p>
<p>with the right set of leaders</p>
<p>that enabled us to do a mission</p>
<p>where we had some latitude.</p>
<p>And, you know, we we we just said, let's</p>
<p>just go give it the best shot we got.</p>
<p>And if we get it, we get it.</p>
<p>And we had a lot of pushback</p>
<p>along the way, but several other</p>
<p>military services still use the basis</p>
<p>for that analysis and what they do</p>
<p>and how they now manage their funding</p>
<p>and their resources on things.</p>
<p>And so they can give a much more accurate</p>
<p>picture of what</p>
<p>they're doing to their leadership</p>
<p>and to the Congress and everyone else.</p>
<p>So I think if you went back</p>
<p>and you asked everybody there</p>
<p>that was a big and defining moment for us</p>
<p>because we</p>
<p>we worked very hard on it and even we</p>
<p>weren't sure we could do it at the start.</p>
<p>But we</p>
<p>we ended up doing something we never</p>
<p>know.</p>
<p>You just product another interesting thing</p>
<p>that I see and great leaders</p>
<p>and it's risk taking you</p>
<p>you could have sat on your hands that day.</p>
<p>And my deputy wished I had.</p>
<p>Yeah. But.</p>
<p>But you didn't because you knew</p>
<p>even that was risky, right?</p>
<p>Because it's big exposure.</p>
<p>You knew you can make a difference.</p>
<p>It is big exposure.</p>
<p>But again, you know,</p>
<p>it comes back to the fact that I knew that</p>
<p>if I tried it and we couldn't do it,</p>
<p>my leaders would have my back.</p>
<p>But what's the opposite to that, Darren?</p>
<p>I mean, you know, when you're</p>
<p>in those situations, you can sit there</p>
<p>and you can say, okay,</p>
<p>then nobody can do it.</p>
<p>And that can never be the answer.</p>
<p>The answer can never be,</p>
<p>Hey, there's nobody that can take it on.</p>
<p>And it is a matter of it is a risk thing,</p>
<p>it's a risk management thing.</p>
<p>And you do have to manage what</p>
<p>you do when you take a risk.</p>
<p>But if you never</p>
<p>take the risk, then how will you know</p>
<p>if you can ever innovate anything?</p>
<p>Like I said when we did it,</p>
<p>I have to tell you, that night</p>
<p>when I went home, I think I had</p>
<p>two glasses of wine and said, okay,</p>
<p>now I know.</p>
<p>I said, we should do this</p>
<p>and I'm confident we can do it.</p>
<p>Do I know how we're going to do it or what</p>
<p>we're going to do? No.</p>
<p>And so that was a little chilling to me.</p>
<p>Well, it's interesting, Betsy,</p>
<p>because you took out you take a risk</p>
<p>and then you went and did it.</p>
<p>And I like what you said here, because I</p>
<p>don't think you realize something.</p>
<p>A lot of people that were that</p>
<p>that were in your shoes or would have been</p>
<p>in your shoes would have said, no,</p>
<p>I just don't think it can be done.</p>
<p>And you said, no, you you're</p>
<p>the type of person if something's on fire,</p>
<p>you go there to help.</p>
<p>You don't run away.</p>
<p>I can tell you look at look at all</p>
<p>of the problems we're facing today, Daryn.</p>
<p>This is about this is about strategic,</p>
<p>strategic insight.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>If you don't try something,</p>
<p>you will never know.</p>
<p>And we have so many difficult problems</p>
<p>that if everybody says it's too hard,</p>
<p>how do we get to</p>
<p>the next gen of nuclear energy?</p>
<p>How do we get to, you know,</p>
<p>electric vehicles and charging stations</p>
<p>that are secure for cars?</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>How do we get to all these other things</p>
<p>if we don't try?</p>
<p>The reason we don't try</p>
<p>is because we're afraid to fail.</p>
<p>What I learned in that experience</p>
<p>is if I fail, I fail.</p>
<p>If you want to fire me, fire me.</p>
<p>There was more than once where I went in</p>
<p>and I was so frustrated I would, you know,</p>
<p>set my card that got me into the Pentagon</p>
<p>and I'd lay it out on the CEO's</p>
<p>desk and say, okay, I'm just done.</p>
<p>Okay,</p>
<p>just just go ahead and I'm done, right?</p>
<p>And he'd say,</p>
<p>Pick that up, put it on, go home,</p>
<p>drink another glass of wine tonight</p>
<p>and I'll see you tomorrow morning.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>And so he was very good about that.</p>
<p>And so</p>
<p>but like I say, I think you you know,</p>
<p>my premise with the team was always</p>
<p>and they know I said two common things.</p>
<p>I always said is figure it out,</p>
<p>go figure it out.</p>
<p>Whatever it is, go figure it out.</p>
<p>And the other</p>
<p>was make them tell, you know.</p>
<p>Oh, and let's.</p>
<p>Make them tell. You know.</p>
<p>Can can you elaborate</p>
<p>a little bit more on that?</p>
<p>Because I think</p>
<p>I know where you're headed.</p>
<p>They're going to want to make sure</p>
<p>everyone understands.</p>
<p>So the answer what you just brought up</p>
<p>is that it's easier just to say no.</p>
<p>Yeah, right.</p>
<p>Yeah. Well,</p>
<p>and that's what everybody does.</p>
<p>It's just. No, because it's too hard.</p>
<p>Well, what,</p>
<p>what an analyst has to be able to do</p>
<p>and a strategist has to be able</p>
<p>to successfully do,</p>
<p>is to make a business case so strong</p>
<p>about the impact of what will happen</p>
<p>if you succeed</p>
<p>that and provide all the data</p>
<p>and information about what's the cost,</p>
<p>what's the timeline, what's the risk.</p>
<p>All of those things.</p>
<p>And with fact based evidence not, hey,</p>
<p>I'm going to gut check this, right?</p>
<p>So you can prove the math</p>
<p>and everything else.</p>
<p>But when you can do that,</p>
<p>then you can take it in.</p>
<p>And I don't care what leader</p>
<p>you put it in front of,</p>
<p>this is why options are good</p>
<p>and not just recommendations.</p>
<p>You know, you give somebody</p>
<p>that's at the top of an organization</p>
<p>and most often you can lay out the options</p>
<p>and you don't have to indicate</p>
<p>what should happen because they look at it</p>
<p>and they go, Duh,</p>
<p>I didn't know this right</p>
<p>or I didn't see this,</p>
<p>or there's a piece of information</p>
<p>that I didn't have that I wasn't aware of,</p>
<p>and that makes a difference.</p>
<p>And they can make a good choice, right?</p>
<p>And so every time we wanted to go</p>
<p>do something and we knew that it probably</p>
<p>was not going to fly on first,</p>
<p>first blush, my advice,</p>
<p>everybody was, you know, build the</p>
<p>business case, make them tell, you know,</p>
<p>and if you really build</p>
<p>a good business case and you can</p>
<p>communicate it quickly and effectively</p>
<p>and with the single sheet of paper</p>
<p>leaders, public or private,</p>
<p>have a hard time telling, you know,</p>
<p>because it makes so much sense.</p>
<p>And it's within the mission, it's</p>
<p>within the scope of the business.</p>
<p>It works for the operation.</p>
<p>It supports the customers.</p>
<p>It's secure.</p>
<p>Why would you not do it right?</p>
<p>Yeah. No, no, I hear you.</p>
<p>So, Betsy, this has been in credible.</p>
<p>Every time I talk to you,</p>
<p>I learn so much more so than</p>
<p>I do.</p>
<p>I'm like.</p>
<p>And I wish. I wish I worked for you.</p>
<p>I wish I had that opportunity</p>
<p>to work for you at some time,</p>
<p>because I would have learned so much</p>
<p>from just your just</p>
<p>your experience</p>
<p>and your your attitude towards leadership.</p>
<p>I think it's wonderful.</p>
<p>Well, I think if there is a bottom line</p>
<p>to leadership these days, it's</p>
<p>it runs through the thread of everything.</p>
<p>And the leader is the linchpin.</p>
<p>If you if you got to figure out how to hit</p>
<p>transformation, if you got to figure out</p>
<p>where you're going with technology,</p>
<p>if you got to figure out anything</p>
<p>about your organization, my challenge to</p>
<p>everybody is go back and review</p>
<p>and redefine leadership development,</p>
<p>because at every point in</p>
<p>the organization these days,</p>
<p>it doesn't matter where you go.</p>
<p>I hear the challenge from leaders</p>
<p>at every level.</p>
<p>We just don't have enough leaders.</p>
<p>They don't know how to do these things.</p>
<p>They aren't open</p>
<p>to these types of suggestions.</p>
<p>They aren't this, that</p>
<p>and the other thing.</p>
<p>And it's because we're working with with</p>
<p>career development systems</p>
<p>and performance management systems</p>
<p>and leadership development</p>
<p>that are all siloed in their own ways</p>
<p>instead of integrated.</p>
<p>And we have to start to develop leaders</p>
<p>who can ask the technology questions</p>
<p>that we couldn't answer before.</p>
<p>We don't have technology leaders.</p>
<p>We don't have any kind of leader</p>
<p>that has grown up</p>
<p>so much in an information world</p>
<p>that we're challenge with now</p>
<p>and learning those things</p>
<p>and teaching people</p>
<p>those things about data analytics and</p>
<p>the use of AI and all of the other pieces.</p>
<p>It's not just technology, right?</p>
<p>Those things are essential</p>
<p>to how well our companies</p>
<p>will perform, how our security</p>
<p>will perform going forward.</p>
<p>And so I would say if there's one lesson</p>
<p>I've learned is that you got to review</p>
<p>and redefine how you develop</p>
<p>your leaders don't just stuff</p>
<p>the new scenarios into the old bag</p>
<p>because the old bag is gone.</p>
<p>It's not about color in outside the box</p>
<p>anymore because the boxes are long gone.</p>
<p>Yeah. It's not a box anymore, is it?</p>
<p>There's not a box anymore.</p>
<p>There's an ecosystem now and it's a lot</p>
<p>bigger and it continues to turn.</p>
<p>It doesn't just sit still like the box.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
