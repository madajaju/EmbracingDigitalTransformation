<p>Hello, this</p>
<p>is Darren Pulsipher, chief solution</p>
<p>architect of public sector at Intel.</p>
<p>And welcome to Embracing</p>
<p>Digital Transformation,</p>
<p>where we investigate effective change,</p>
<p>leveraging people, process</p>
<p>and technology.</p>
<p>On todays</p>
<p>episode, Information driven leadership</p>
<p>with Betsy Freeman, CEO of Radius</p>
<p>Advisory Group.</p>
<p>Betsy, welcome to the show.</p>
<p>Thank you, Darren So great to be here.</p>
<p>I appreciate the invitation.</p>
<p>So, Betsy</p>
<p>Freeman, you live up in Michigan now,</p>
<p>but this is where you retired,</p>
<p>but you're not retired because I think</p>
<p>you love you love this industry so much.</p>
<p>I do.</p>
<p>So I love the</p>
<p>the whole idea of problem solution.</p>
<p>And I think we have plenty of problems</p>
<p>that I'm I'm hoping</p>
<p>that I can contribute</p>
<p>to some solutions here along the way.</p>
<p>So let's talk a little bit about your</p>
<p>your career and your background,</p>
<p>because when I say you're retired,</p>
<p>you're really not retired.</p>
<p>You just retired</p>
<p>from working for the government.</p>
<p>That's right.</p>
<p>I retired from the federal space,</p>
<p>although by</p>
<p>proxy, I think I sometimes still work</p>
<p>there.</p>
<p>I'm a little bit of an odd duck.</p>
<p>Most people take the the route of,</p>
<p>you know, either public or private sector.</p>
<p>But I kind of found a challenge</p>
<p>in saying that, you know what?</p>
<p>Let's just see if you could do both.</p>
<p>And people kind of warned me against that.</p>
<p>But I have to say, it's</p>
<p>been the most exciting part of my my</p>
<p>professional journey.</p>
<p>I started out as an active duty service</p>
<p>member in the United States Air Force.</p>
<p>I love the department</p>
<p>and resigned my commission</p>
<p>because I had too many children</p>
<p>and a spouse</p>
<p>going in too many different directions</p>
<p>and somebody had to not be in.</p>
<p>My spouse and I were both on active duty,</p>
<p>so mom jumped out.</p>
<p>I was fortunate to to land in big industry</p>
<p>and spent a great deal of time</p>
<p>at Pricewaterhouse, then Pricewaterhouse</p>
<p>Coopers through its merger,</p>
<p>working in a number of industries.</p>
<p>But the last industry I worked in</p>
<p>was the utility and energy industry,</p>
<p>and then did what I really wanted to do</p>
<p>is to go back to the DOD.</p>
<p>And I was very fortunate</p>
<p>to have been selected to go back to work</p>
<p>in the DOJ with</p>
<p>Secretary Gates when he was running</p>
<p>as a efficiencies task force</p>
<p>and stayed on Under Secretary Panetta</p>
<p>as he did</p>
<p>a lot more work for the department</p>
<p>when he became secretary.</p>
<p>Then I had an interesting journey</p>
<p>to the DOD CIO</p>
<p>and stayed</p>
<p>there and was appointed as a deputy CIO</p>
<p>and then made kind of full circle</p>
<p>coming back out of there</p>
<p>and have now founded my own consultancy</p>
<p>in the last place you would expect.</p>
<p>And that's how in Michigan,</p>
<p>on the wonderful Lake Michigan shore</p>
<p>out of the Washington</p>
<p>limelight and busyness and</p>
<p>and much to my great contentment.</p>
<p>Well and you guys hosted Intel there</p>
<p>recently.</p>
<p>I got to go to Holland, Michigan.</p>
<p>It's a wonderful, whole wonderful place.</p>
<p>Beautiful.</p>
<p>So I appreciated</p>
<p>that I got to see a part of Michigan</p>
<p>I've never seen before.</p>
<p>As did we.</p>
<p>It was a it was a privilege to have.</p>
<p>Have you all here.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>So you've you've been at that</p>
<p>you've been at the high ranks</p>
<p>of public sector information technology</p>
<p>as a see as a deputy CEO.</p>
<p>And tell me, what were the biggest</p>
<p>challenges that you guys ran into?</p>
<p>Well, there's the list of challenges</p>
<p>probably you get.</p>
<p>You have to have a couple of rolls</p>
<p>of toilet paper to write them all out.</p>
<p>But what I would say</p>
<p>in my in my particular role</p>
<p>there and the DOD CIO</p>
<p>and I think this is true across</p>
<p>public sector as well as private sector,</p>
<p>the biggest challenge is always to look at</p>
<p>how do you bring new thinking,</p>
<p>new processes, new technologies,</p>
<p>new methods of working kind of overnight,</p>
<p>if you will, right into organizations</p>
<p>that are big.</p>
<p>They have enormous scope.</p>
<p>They have a lot of silos.</p>
<p>Everybody has their own PNL</p>
<p>or their own budget.</p>
<p>There's all sorts of agendas,</p>
<p>professional and private, across</p>
<p>all of those things.</p>
<p>And how do you actually</p>
<p>how do you actually help</p>
<p>to institute change</p>
<p>in those kinds of environments?</p>
<p>We actually got a little an interesting</p>
<p>kind of sunglasses on</p>
<p>that this last couple of years</p>
<p>because of COVID.</p>
<p>And I've always been</p>
<p>one of those kind of disruptor people</p>
<p>that has said,</p>
<p>you know, the best innovation</p>
<p>actually always occurs</p>
<p>in the greatest when we're under</p>
<p>the greatest level of distress.</p>
<p>And I think we've seen that.</p>
<p>And I think that, you know, from</p>
<p>from a DOD perspective, you know,</p>
<p>probably one of the largest organizations</p>
<p>or the largest organization</p>
<p>from a business process, admissions</p>
<p>stance in the world.</p>
<p>That is absolutely true.</p>
<p>It's it's just a hard thing</p>
<p>to try to get across all that</p>
<p>and then to deal with the culture,</p>
<p>which, again,</p>
<p>is similar to any other organization.</p>
<p>Every organization has their own culture</p>
<p>and their own way of doing things.</p>
<p>And so trying to change that</p>
<p>at the drop of a hat,</p>
<p>which was one of my tasks</p>
<p>as I went into my deputy CIO role there,</p>
<p>because there was a very specific mission</p>
<p>element that they created</p>
<p>and they wanted executed</p>
<p>like and start over night.</p>
<p>And there was no rules, no boundaries</p>
<p>and also</p>
<p>no advocacy from anybody senior</p>
<p>except the most senior people</p>
<p>and actually how to get that done so</p>
<p>it's introduced to is tough.</p>
<p>Yeah you you brought up culture</p>
<p>as being probably one of the toughest</p>
<p>things to overcome do you feel</p>
<p>and you can say this from the outside</p>
<p>because you were on the outside</p>
<p>during COVID did you see that</p>
<p>COVID changed the culture at all</p>
<p>in in these big organizations</p>
<p>like the DOD?</p>
<p>I think it did in some ways</p>
<p>and in other ways</p>
<p>it made people hunker down even more.</p>
<p>And that's bad interest.</p>
<p>I think we were challenged all</p>
<p>by going to work overnight someplace else.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>And that</p>
<p>brought up all the the various technology</p>
<p>challenges.</p>
<p>It brings up a lot of process challenge.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>And I think we learned a lot</p>
<p>if we were smart</p>
<p>and I think we did across the board,</p>
<p>both in DOD and</p>
<p>and in other big federal agencies</p>
<p>and and in the commercial sector as well,</p>
<p>I think we learned and are still learning</p>
<p>lessons right from what that looks like.</p>
<p>But what worries me is the talk</p>
<p>of every place,</p>
<p>you know, how are we heading</p>
<p>back into the office and how are we?</p>
<p>So it's like all this new environment</p>
<p>that we this ecosystem</p>
<p>that we got shoved into.</p>
<p>And I think, you know, good or bad,</p>
<p>you can make that judgment.</p>
<p>But because you're now there</p>
<p>and you've taken the step,</p>
<p>why would you try to stuff</p>
<p>that back into the old bag?</p>
<p>And I think companies and the DOD in</p>
<p>some ways is still trying to do that.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>And I say</p>
<p>that with great respect</p>
<p>to leaders in every organization,</p>
<p>because this is not an easy thing</p>
<p>to be able to navigate.</p>
<p>But once you make a shift,</p>
<p>one of the things</p>
<p>I've always said to people and they always</p>
<p>look at me and go, Now it doesn't matter</p>
<p>where you are, I say, sprint everything.</p>
<p>And it's, it's why spreads everything.</p>
<p>Betsy That just you just get too tired</p>
<p>and you this and you that now.</p>
<p>Okay, so now I'm going to divert</p>
<p>and just a really quick story.</p>
<p>If I if I may,</p>
<p>I learned the lesson of Sprint</p>
<p>everything when I was a deputy CIO,</p>
<p>we had various projects</p>
<p>that we were given on top of the mission</p>
<p>we were supposed to execute.</p>
<p>And every time we would go into these big</p>
<p>meetings, everyone would get their piece</p>
<p>of the of the of the projects</p>
<p>that they were supposed to be working on.</p>
<p>And they would all get 30 days</p>
<p>and then they would turn to my team</p>
<p>and they would say,</p>
<p>That's it, we're giving this piece to you</p>
<p>and you get ten days.</p>
<p>Well, I kind of got irritated with that.</p>
<p>I was like, why does everybody else</p>
<p>get 30 days and I get ten days right?</p>
<p>So after about the second or third time</p>
<p>that happened, I went to the leadership</p>
<p>and said, you know, with great respect,</p>
<p>let me ask a question about why it is</p>
<p>I only get ten days.</p>
<p>And they said, well, in reality,</p>
<p>because we know</p>
<p>you can pull your team together</p>
<p>and actually accomplish it in ten days.</p>
<p>But the bigger reason is, is that we have</p>
<p>to make some very complex decisions</p>
<p>and that information is part</p>
<p>of a bigger decision making process.</p>
<p>And the faster we can have it, the better</p>
<p>we feel like we can make</p>
<p>the timeliness of those decisions,</p>
<p>and there's a big impact on those things.</p>
<p>And so I learned the lesson</p>
<p>then when I went back</p>
<p>and said to my team, Hey, we got ten days,</p>
<p>we got to do this.</p>
<p>And they looked at me</p>
<p>and said, You know, you're joking, right?</p>
<p>And I said, No. And they said,</p>
<p>How are we going to do this?</p>
<p>And I said, I don't know,</p>
<p>but you know what?</p>
<p>Let's figure it out.</p>
<p>And we did.</p>
<p>And once we figured it out,</p>
<p>a lot of different times over</p>
<p>and over and over, because our deadline</p>
<p>was always ten days, guess what?</p>
<p>We got really good at it</p>
<p>and we could do it in ten days.</p>
<p>We could even do it</p>
<p>better than people that had 30 days</p>
<p>because we didn't screw around, because</p>
<p>we got rid of all the extraneous things</p>
<p>that we didn't need to help senior leaders</p>
<p>make those decisions.</p>
<p>So, so, so. This is numeracy.</p>
<p>I want to tap into this a little bit.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So I, I saw this same sort of thing</p>
<p>during COVID when I talked to other CIOs,</p>
<p>you didn't have,</p>
<p>Oh, I need five months to go analyze</p>
<p>this problem.</p>
<p>No, because no one can work.</p>
<p>Yeah, exactly. Right.</p>
<p>It needs to be done now.</p>
<p>So that that sense of urgency.</p>
<p>Do you feel like that sense of urgency</p>
<p>really helps people focus</p>
<p>and helps get rid of the</p>
<p>the chaff for no better word, right?</p>
<p>All the extraneous stuff</p>
<p>that doesn't really provide any value.</p>
<p>Well, I think that's</p>
<p>where the real challenge lies.</p>
<p>I think people generally</p>
<p>will have a sense of urgency</p>
<p>if you tell them they only have a short</p>
<p>deadline to do things.</p>
<p>But, you know, as a leader,</p>
<p>you have to ensure that</p>
<p>when you're asking people to do that,</p>
<p>that they're equipped with the people</p>
<p>and the resources and the authority</p>
<p>to go and execute something</p>
<p>on a shortened timeline like that.</p>
<p>And if they have it,</p>
<p>which as a deputy CIO,</p>
<p>I was given great support in that regard.</p>
<p>If they have it, then, you know,</p>
<p>it's like ripping the Band-Aid off.</p>
<p>You just you go and you do it.</p>
<p>And once you do it, you can you can help</p>
<p>to kind of institutionalize it.</p>
<p>But unless you have a leadership</p>
<p>that's going to support that,</p>
<p>I think it's really hard to get to that.</p>
<p>I think there could be a sense of urgency,</p>
<p>but people just say,</p>
<p>How are we supposed to do that?</p>
<p>You got to have somebody</p>
<p>that's going to lead the charge</p>
<p>and come back</p>
<p>and not just say, Hey, go figure it out.</p>
<p>But, you know, you walk back</p>
<p>and you actually sit down with the team</p>
<p>and you say, okay, and you hear all that</p>
<p>good points and you do it together.</p>
<p>And and I think that's a hard thing</p>
<p>to do in this environment,</p>
<p>but I think it's a necessary thing</p>
<p>to do.</p>
<p>You think that I know there was a big push</p>
<p>in the nineties and 2000 still like</p>
<p>everything's matrixed, right?</p>
<p>Everything's Matrixed.</p>
<p>And do you think that has caused</p>
<p>some of the quagmire that we're in</p>
<p>where things are slowed down</p>
<p>because there are so many</p>
<p>people that have to have a voice</p>
<p>or that have to help make a decision.</p>
<p>Well, in the end, I think it's important</p>
<p>to listen to people.</p>
<p>But let's face it, decision</p>
<p>making gets made at the top.</p>
<p>And that should that should generally mean</p>
<p>that it's a few people.</p>
<p>I'm having a matrix organization.</p>
<p>It may have added layers of complexity,</p>
<p>but most of the situations we're talking</p>
<p>about were so complex already that it</p>
<p>probably doesn't make any difference</p>
<p>in the end, you know, and I'm going to</p>
<p>this is going to be a common theme.</p>
<p>I think what we're talking about today</p>
<p>is it really does</p>
<p>come back to the leadership.</p>
<p>You have to be inclusive enough</p>
<p>to listen to everyone.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>But that can't take five months</p>
<p>and 150 meetings.</p>
<p>Right? It can't.</p>
<p>You have to</p>
<p>you have to come up with ways to systems,</p>
<p>automated systems and groups</p>
<p>that can do ideation</p>
<p>and come up together and suggest models</p>
<p>and work with each other,</p>
<p>not just talk about being collaborative,</p>
<p>but actually doing it together.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Which is kind of what we invited you here</p>
<p>to work with us when you came to Olin.</p>
<p>And what we were trying to do with</p>
<p>the interview</p>
<p>was to kind of</p>
<p>let you inside of our processes, right?</p>
<p>So you could see how we do this stuff.</p>
<p>But I think that's the that's the key.</p>
<p>You have to be able to</p>
<p>to have that ability and be able to turn</p>
<p>and kind of turn a burden, if you will,</p>
<p>with all of the situations that come up.</p>
<p>And you can't take forever.</p>
<p>I think people have good intentions,</p>
<p>but unless the leadership</p>
<p>and ables them to act</p>
<p>because they have the tools and the people</p>
<p>and the automation and it's not</p>
<p>lots of people, it's the right people.</p>
<p>It's probably less people</p>
<p>but the right people, right?</p>
<p>Less technology, but the right technology</p>
<p>to try to help them get to what you need.</p>
<p>Gotcha.</p>
<p>Okay. I love how I love how this is going.</p>
<p>And you as the leader,</p>
<p>you kind of said where doing this.</p>
<p>So it wasn't like, what do you guys think?</p>
<p>You think we can do this?</p>
<p>Yeah. Wow.</p>
<p>It's pretty easy</p>
<p>when the CIO is getting direction</p>
<p>directly from the DEP, SecDef</p>
<p>and the secretary</p>
<p>and when he comes and says,</p>
<p>Hey, Betsy, we're going to do this.</p>
<p>And I go, What? We're going to do what?</p>
<p>And he goes, We're going to do this right.</p>
<p>And the secretary wants to know that we're</p>
<p>going out, we're going to get it done.</p>
<p>And the answer can only be absolutely,</p>
<p>we will get it done.</p>
<p>And then when you figure out how to do it.</p>
<p>So how do you</p>
<p>how do you motivate your team?</p>
<p>Because obviously, the first</p>
<p>time this happened to you,</p>
<p>it must have been your team.</p>
<p>You already said it.</p>
<p>Your team was like Betsy. No. Yeah, no.</p>
<p>So that a lot of pushback there.</p>
<p>I learned a lot of lessons inside that.</p>
<p>I had a very large team,</p>
<p>then I had about 50 analysts and</p>
<p>I had just begun to kind of learn</p>
<p>the skill sets of each of those analysts</p>
<p>and to learn them as people.</p>
<p>By my a few months out from that,</p>
<p>I knew their dog's name, their kid's</p>
<p>name, their wife's name,</p>
<p>what they ate at lunch.</p>
<p>And I also knew all the skill</p>
<p>sets, the primary and the secondary</p>
<p>and the tertiary skill sets</p>
<p>that they actually had.</p>
<p>And what I determined</p>
<p>was, is taken that in taking a problem</p>
<p>into a big group of people</p>
<p>and getting everybody to give me</p>
<p>their opinion on how it should work,</p>
<p>I was actually very useless</p>
<p>and it</p>
<p>wasn't that their input was useless.</p>
<p>It was that you couldn't</p>
<p>do anything with that.</p>
<p>I had to make a decision. We had to go.</p>
<p>So what we ended up doing</p>
<p>is we kind of created an interesting model</p>
<p>where because we knew what skill sets</p>
<p>people had,</p>
<p>we took the problem</p>
<p>and if you will, kind of set it</p>
<p>in the middle of the room and said, Hey,</p>
<p>we're going to cherry pick.</p>
<p>And my average was seven people.</p>
<p>I tried to keep it to five</p>
<p>and we would pick the people</p>
<p>with the skill sets and with kind of the,</p>
<p>the, the, the cognitive skills.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>The cognitive diversity to be able</p>
<p>to sit at the table and figure it out.</p>
<p>And if they needed somebody else,</p>
<p>like if they needed a data scientist,</p>
<p>you know, in those days</p>
<p>I could call Intel,</p>
<p>I could, I could get a few minutes</p>
<p>of a data scientist time.</p>
<p>I had a data scientist on staff that</p>
<p>I could have 0.3 of his time every month.</p>
<p>So what we did was we we fit the skills</p>
<p>and the abilities of the team to the task.</p>
<p>And we said, solve the problem.</p>
<p>And much to my surprise, repeatedly,</p>
<p>they blew it out of the water.</p>
<p>Sometimes</p>
<p>we would get questions</p>
<p>that, you know, we would get,</p>
<p>hey, can we have this in an hour</p>
<p>from the office?</p>
<p>We very quickly got to a point</p>
<p>where it wasn't shocking all right.</p>
<p>For us, it was like, okay,</p>
<p>who do we need to solve the problem?</p>
<p>How fast can we do it?</p>
<p>And we had set up templates and things</p>
<p>for ourselves to be able to provide an</p>
<p>input back to</p>
<p>the set up</p>
<p>for consideration</p>
<p>and the CIO for consideration.</p>
<p>And we had some fun with that.</p>
<p>But at the end of the day,</p>
<p>we had a process in place</p>
<p>that allowed us to do that</p>
<p>ideation to come up with options,</p>
<p>because that's what we did.</p>
<p>We took a neutral stance.</p>
<p>We didn't say, you know, Mr.</p>
<p>Dubcek, that for Mr.</p>
<p>CIO, this what you need to go do.</p>
<p>We said here are the options</p>
<p>that you have based on the data</p>
<p>that we know, the</p>
<p>you know, the level of accuracy</p>
<p>that we believe that that data represents</p>
<p>the budgets, you know,</p>
<p>scenarios, the political scenarios,</p>
<p>the support we have from our</p>
<p>board of</p>
<p>directors,</p>
<p>all 435 of them over on the Hill.</p>
<p>So you chip</p>
<p>in all of those considerations, right?</p>
<p>The timeline that you have,</p>
<p>the impact of the soldiers and sailors</p>
<p>and their families and all those things,</p>
<p>and and we give options.</p>
<p>And so and so we stayed out</p>
<p>of the decision making.</p>
<p>And so we could just lay out facts</p>
<p>and evidence.</p>
<p>But but in essence, you</p>
<p>I love what you said here</p>
<p>because you didn't tell your team</p>
<p>how to do the work.</p>
<p>Oh, no, no.</p>
<p>Which is very empowering, Betsy,</p>
<p>because a lot of managers come in and say,</p>
<p>okay, we need to get this done.</p>
<p>This is how we're going to do it.</p>
<p>Instead you said this is the team</p>
<p>that's going to get this</p>
<p>done, do it, and they figured it out.</p>
<p>Yeah, that's pretty empowering.</p>
<p>They I had a lot of faith in them and</p>
<p>they like that a lot.</p>
<p>I think it was very motivating</p>
<p>because they would always</p>
<p>be looking for new assignments</p>
<p>and what could they do next.</p>
<p>And people argue a lot</p>
<p>that about being able to be on the team</p>
<p>and while we had a large group of analysts</p>
<p>there,</p>
<p>we because of the nature of the problems</p>
<p>that we were given, you know,</p>
<p>they were all sorts of disciplines</p>
<p>and all sorts of requirements.</p>
<p>So we ended up using</p>
<p>all the members of the team.</p>
<p>We might have six or seven teams going out</p>
<p>at a single time on different problems.</p>
<p>Right. And 5 to 7 people</p>
<p>probably on each team.</p>
<p>Some we could use less, some</p>
<p>we needed a few more.</p>
<p>But it just</p>
<p>it kind of emerged in a way where</p>
<p>I've never as a leader of any team,</p>
<p>assumed that I knew</p>
<p>the best way to approach things.</p>
<p>I just I've never done that.</p>
<p>I may have my ideas right,</p>
<p>but 99% of the time,</p>
<p>these teams of people</p>
<p>and I'm I'm really fortunate in that</p>
<p>you can only say this when you actually</p>
<p>surround yourself with really good people.</p>
<p>And I had many of them then. Right.</p>
<p>And these were all different</p>
<p>contracts.</p>
<p>So they were all contractors</p>
<p>from industry, all different companies.</p>
<p>And so yeah, so we, we,</p>
<p>we were fortunate</p>
<p>to have really good people.</p>
<p>And in that regard, you know,</p>
<p>people wanted to be on projects.</p>
<p>They were anxious to have an opportunity</p>
<p>to give ideas.</p>
<p>I think employees</p>
<p>and I think you see this today,</p>
<p>I think it's why the great resignation</p>
<p>thing still keeps going.</p>
<p>People that are employees want to know</p>
<p>that leaders are listening to them.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>And that they're actually taking</p>
<p>in their ideas and considering them</p>
<p>and that's what this</p>
<p>that's what this approach did.</p>
<p>It allowed people to tell you,</p>
<p>you know, with their best analysis,</p>
<p>what options were and oftentimes</p>
<p>it was a combination of those analysis</p>
<p>that we put together to give actual</p>
<p>options right back to the leadership.</p>
<p>But the fact that we could do that quickly</p>
<p>and we got rid of all the junk</p>
<p>between the members of the team</p>
<p>and with the culture that was</p>
<p>kind of surrounding us in the department.</p>
<p>We were in our own little environment,</p>
<p>right where we were allowed to do that.</p>
<p>And that's a credit to to the leadership</p>
<p>of the department in the CIO's office,</p>
<p>the CIO and the principal deputy CIO,</p>
<p>because they recognize that</p>
<p>if they let us go,</p>
<p>we could turn this stuff and come up</p>
<p>with options</p>
<p>that other people weren't arriving at.</p>
<p>And so it was.</p>
<p>How often</p>
<p>how often would you use the same group</p>
<p>of people over and over again?</p>
<p>Was it everything there?</p>
<p>Got something new?</p>
<p>I, I,</p>
<p>I had the opportunity to form a new team.</p>
<p>So I did every single</p>
<p>time we had a new problem.</p>
<p>And that way</p>
<p>that the reason I did that was twofold.</p>
<p>One, it gave an opportunity</p>
<p>for four different people to work on</p>
<p>different kinds of work because I think</p>
<p>as a consultant or an analyst,</p>
<p>if you get too beholden to one area,</p>
<p>you kind of get myopic.</p>
<p>I believe I'm a strong believer</p>
<p>in a multidisciplinary approach</p>
<p>and just about everything</p>
<p>that we do, right?</p>
<p>Because you don't know what you don't know</p>
<p>because you don't see it</p>
<p>from the other guy's shoes</p>
<p>because you never been in them.</p>
<p>So the only way you'll learn</p>
<p>that is to is to get people.</p>
<p>And so you would and so we would just</p>
<p>instantly form new teams, right?</p>
<p>It was a very quick process.</p>
<p>The other thing that I found there,</p>
<p>and this stemmed from an initial problem</p>
<p>I had, was that I had very young</p>
<p>consultants.</p>
<p>I had some,</p>
<p>you know, mid-career consultants</p>
<p>and I had some more mature consultants.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>And as you know,</p>
<p>there's a kind of a generational divide</p>
<p>kind of across all of that</p>
<p>when you look at the reality of it.</p>
<p>So we would mix young and old together</p>
<p>and mid-tier to</p>
<p>and sometimes people wouldn't like that.</p>
<p>And they'd come and they'd say something.</p>
<p>And then by the end of the time</p>
<p>they were done with the project.</p>
<p>It was all about, Do</p>
<p>you know how much I learned from this guy?</p>
<p>And sometimes that was people like me</p>
<p>with gray hair</p>
<p>saying, okay,</p>
<p>I was really irritated when you did this</p>
<p>and you made this young person</p>
<p>come and do this, this,</p>
<p>but they really taught me a lot</p>
<p>about how to look at this technology</p>
<p>through this lens. Right.</p>
<p>And the younger people were</p>
<p>in the same boat where they said, hey,</p>
<p>we were thinking we're getting stuck</p>
<p>with the old guys. Right. But in the end,</p>
<p>to have the benefit of knowing</p>
<p>why policies and procedures</p>
<p>were established the way they were</p>
<p>and having the history of it,</p>
<p>that gave you the context</p>
<p>of what you needed to understand</p>
<p>to be able to change it in the right way,</p>
<p>right, and update it</p>
<p>without totally just dismantling</p>
<p>the whole thing,</p>
<p>which is oftentimes what you end up doing.</p>
<p>And so, yeah, so there was,</p>
<p>there was a good reason for that.</p>
<p>But we,</p>
<p>we got to know our people very well.</p>
<p>It was me and a deputy</p>
<p>and we could just very quickly say,</p>
<p>you know, pull this person,</p>
<p>this person, this person and go.</p>
<p>And if they were working on something</p>
<p>else,</p>
<p>we'd say, Hey, can you work on two things?</p>
<p>And I don't think I ever had anybody say,</p>
<p>No, I can't work on two things.</p>
<p>They just they just did it.</p>
<p>I don't know how they did it,</p>
<p>but they did it.</p>
<p>That's that's pretty incredible.</p>
<p>So, Betsy, this this sounds incredible</p>
<p>because of your leadership skills.</p>
<p>Obviously, we are are very fine tuned</p>
<p>now that you've gone through this process.</p>
