<p>ï»¿1</p>
<p>Hello, this</p>
<p>is Darren Pulsipher, chief solution</p>
<p>architect of public sector at Intel.</p>
<p>And welcome to Embracing</p>
<p>Digital Transformation,</p>
<p>where we investigate effective change,</p>
<p>leveraging people, process</p>
<p>and technology.</p>
<p>On today's episode, Dr.</p>
<p>Anna Scott and Leland</p>
<p>Brown unleashing future use cases</p>
<p>with 5G.</p>
<p>You've opened up a lot of capability.</p>
<p>I can do my own private networks.</p>
<p>I it's software defined so I can add a lot</p>
<p>more functionality to my network now.</p>
<p>What does this unlock, Dr.</p>
<p>Scott?</p>
<p>Where where do you take where do you take</p>
<p>this enabling technology?</p>
<p>Fantastic.</p>
<p>So so we see.</p>
<p>Well, what's the best way to say it?</p>
<p>So we are still in the early days</p>
<p>of, say, from a USB</p>
<p>like a bandwidth in the latency</p>
<p>standpoint,</p>
<p>what are the real advantages of 5G?</p>
<p>What we're seeing</p>
<p>with a lot of our first sets of customers</p>
<p>is what we've already talked about</p>
<p>is the the opening up of the spectrum</p>
<p>like the CBR as the ability</p>
<p>to take advantage</p>
<p>of the existing user equipment</p>
<p>and now make it possible to have folks</p>
<p>have mobile access.</p>
<p>Right. So like one use case that is</p>
<p>not at</p>
<p>all sexy but actually has really huge</p>
<p>ramifications is</p>
<p>can you take your your laptop</p>
<p>and onto the factory floor and start</p>
<p>using that for full connectivity?</p>
<p>So instead of going</p>
<p>out with a piece of paper and a notepad</p>
<p>and writing down the stuff that matters,</p>
<p>then going back to your office</p>
<p>to do your heavy work,</p>
<p>you actually can converge</p>
<p>those two environments.</p>
<p>And, and again, it's enabled</p>
<p>by the 5G standards but isn't necessarily</p>
<p>doing like a full 5G deployment.</p>
<p>What we're seeing and what we think</p>
<p>will be the evolution on that</p>
<p>and that's happening</p>
<p>kind of in real time right now, is</p>
<p>can you stream</p>
<p>high definition video</p>
<p>from a camera over 5G, do real time</p>
<p>analytics on it,</p>
<p>and now you've got a wireless camera</p>
<p>that's in whatever the environment is</p>
<p>that you care about.</p>
<p>Carry that again, that video over 5G and</p>
<p>and then do your analytics on it</p>
<p>and have that be low</p>
<p>enough latency that you're essentially</p>
<p>having a real time system.</p>
<p>We're not quite there</p>
<p>because the 5G cameras still</p>
<p>there's not many of them that</p>
<p>can really operate in that environment.</p>
<p>So often what we'll do with a 5G</p>
<p>network is we'll still hardwire</p>
<p>the cameras to close coupled edge compute</p>
<p>to get that real time aspect.</p>
<p>And then you can share up the the metadata</p>
<p>and the output of those analytics.</p>
<p>So we're not very far away at all</p>
<p>from saying now</p>
<p>that we've got that massive bandwidth</p>
<p>in that low latency.</p>
<p>Now streaming</p>
<p>becomes an option and and that has some</p>
<p>really nice advantages, right?</p>
<p>So that brought up something else</p>
<p>that just popped into my head.</p>
<p>What about air?</p>
<p>Exactly. Yeah.</p>
<p>And that's the other huge</p>
<p>example for that.</p>
<p>Right, is</p>
<p>you can definitely do like air headsets</p>
<p>over wi fi,</p>
<p>but the information that we have is</p>
<p>if you're doing a single headset,</p>
<p>you're great.</p>
<p>If you want to do two headsets,</p>
<p>you're probably okay.</p>
<p>If you want to bring that up to scale</p>
<p>and do more like ten or 20.</p>
<p>WI fi is not very well-equipped</p>
<p>to be able to handle that and keep</p>
<p>a good, you know, non</p>
<p>well keep the system working in a way</p>
<p>that's going to make</p>
<p>everybody have the real time experience</p>
<p>that they want.</p>
<p>Whereas for 5G,</p>
<p>that's a no brainer, right?</p>
<p>But leave in place.</p>
<p>Now, I was going to add</p>
<p>and a perfect, perfect point</p>
<p>when you think about a 5G on premise</p>
<p>network, this</p>
<p>there's a couple of key elements to that</p>
<p>you have to have in place.</p>
<p>The core</p>
<p>the more way to compute</p>
<p>the general brand</p>
<p>and also the user playing function</p>
<p>which which is a core phone function,</p>
<p>meaning</p>
<p>within the warehouse</p>
<p>you have all those elements.</p>
<p>Key point is the Mac that provides you</p>
<p>the ability to give you these</p>
<p>applications on on premise</p>
<p>instead of having to go back</p>
<p>to any switch or let's say,</p>
<p>you know, develop</p>
<p>like a core of the carrier</p>
<p>and have that ran time.</p>
<p>You're you're on premise this private is</p>
<p>dedicated as a dedicated network.</p>
<p>You know, wi fi doesn't</p>
<p>have those functions, of course.</p>
<p>So this is good for security, too.</p>
<p>Well, yeah, it.</p>
<p>Provides my data is not going outside</p>
<p>of my building.</p>
<p>I can make that out.</p>
<p>Right. Exactly.</p>
<p>And and then you think about</p>
<p>and I mentioned about, again, frequencies.</p>
<p>Well,</p>
<p>two two things need to occur right now.</p>
<p>There are certain carriers</p>
<p>that of play frequencies.</p>
<p>Millimeter wave in ways</p>
<p>that they probably should not have</p>
<p>because the wave has challenges</p>
<p>and there's other carriers</p>
<p>that have deployed lower frequencies.</p>
<p>And I'm not saying that they really</p>
<p>understood it, not saying it did not.</p>
<p>But it's as you can see, the performance</p>
<p>in a network is different.</p>
<p>So understanding how you deploy</p>
<p>frequencies relative to the use case</p>
<p>is extremely important for one</p>
<p>and therefore two frequencies</p>
<p>react very differently in the world.</p>
<p>And when you deploy in these on a net net</p>
<p>network, you have to have</p>
<p>that level of understanding.</p>
<p>So these on premise deployments,</p>
<p>on premise network deployments,</p>
<p>the MEC is is it's very important to it.</p>
<p>Your RF design is extremely important.</p>
<p>And having all those elements on premise</p>
<p>gives you the ability</p>
<p>to have an independence, to design it</p>
<p>for you, for your own use cases and needs.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>You threw out the word MEC.</p>
<p>What in the world? Mobile edge.</p>
<p>Mobile edge compute.</p>
<p>All right, because I don't think</p>
<p>everyone's familiar with that.</p>
<p>I know I'm I kind of know it because and.</p>
<p>Pretty tight on me.</p>
<p>Yeah. Yeah exactly.</p>
<p>So MSE that's so that mobile edge compute</p>
<p>that's that</p>
<p>that could be that could be in AR headset.</p>
<p>It could be an edge</p>
<p>device that's feeding a bunch of data</p>
<p>streams, coming in video streams.</p>
<p>It could be any, anything that's out there</p>
<p>that's doing my edge computing, right?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And I think I don't know that</p>
<p>we've quite gotten to a level</p>
<p>where a headset would be considered a mac.</p>
<p>I think almost always now there's still</p>
<p>there's still.</p>
<p>Something nearby that's doing that. Right.</p>
<p>That is that then would have a device</p>
<p>that's been the,</p>
<p>the headset device would be attached back</p>
<p>into that Mac.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>And it would be</p>
<p>doing some support functionality</p>
<p>even if you're doing a lot of compute.</p>
<p>I want, I want glasses that are a mac.</p>
<p>Ideally a little higher</p>
<p>and a little heavy right now.</p>
<p>Hey, it's a we're working</p>
<p>we're going down to 1.8 nanometers, right?</p>
<p>That's 18 angstrom.</p>
<p>So I can fit a lot of transistors in.</p>
<p>Whereas Lossless Moore's Law still exists.</p>
<p>That's pushing it.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, absolutely.</p>
<p>What about outside the country?</p>
<p>Because we've been talking</p>
<p>inside the factory quite a bit.</p>
<p>What are some of those other edge</p>
<p>use cases that</p>
<p>Well, I think one of the things</p>
<p>that we've been exploring for a while</p>
<p>that is more kind of emergency response is</p>
<p>how can you really use drones</p>
<p>and how can you keep your drones</p>
<p>connected?</p>
<p>So I think probably one of the biggest use</p>
<p>cases and again, this is</p>
<p>this is early days.</p>
<p>We've done some testing with this, but not</p>
<p>not for hey, you've just come in</p>
<p>and stood up your 5G network</p>
<p>and you're bringing your drones</p>
<p>to do an assessment of a damaged area.</p>
<p>But what we have done is kind of</p>
<p>the earlier predecessor to that, which is</p>
<p>how can you get drones to be connected</p>
<p>and have a mission and understand</p>
<p>what's happening and go over</p>
<p>and do do the types of flyovers to say,</p>
<p>hey, you've just had a major storm</p>
<p>or you've had flooding</p>
<p>or there's been a hurricane.</p>
<p>How do you pull that kind of data together</p>
<p>and bring all of that camera data?</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>So again, we're not quite to the stream</p>
<p>live video back from multiple drones</p>
<p>and stitch that all together</p>
<p>but we're getting</p>
<p>we're getting into the line of sight where</p>
<p>now you can use a use a drone to actually</p>
<p>gather that data, combine</p>
<p>all that data, analyze that data and say,</p>
<p>here are the areas where you need</p>
<p>help, or, hey, I see a person who needs</p>
<p>immediate attention or,</p>
<p>Hey, this house is no longer there.</p>
<p>And when you can</p>
<p>do that with 5G, you</p>
<p>I mean, we can do a lot of that now.</p>
<p>What we can't do is do that</p>
<p>in real time, right?</p>
<p>The immediate intelligence. Right. And so.</p>
<p>Okay, so.</p>
<p>So this is search and rescue,</p>
<p>including firefighting, because I know</p>
<p>we're doing this in California now.</p>
<p>We are sending drones up.</p>
<p>They are on a 5G network</p>
<p>that's a private 5G network</p>
<p>that's stood up</p>
<p>specifically for firefighting.</p>
<p>But I love the search and rescue</p>
<p>after hurricanes or floods or whatever.</p>
<p>A great use case. Yeah.</p>
<p>And just to add to to what Joanna stated,</p>
<p>I mean, think about it,</p>
<p>the metaverse</p>
<p>and the discussion around the metaverse</p>
<p>of how on premise networks</p>
<p>find it hard to imagine the</p>
<p>realities of it.</p>
<p>Right. It's</p>
<p>having</p>
<p>having edge compute points on premise</p>
<p>allows you to have these distributed</p>
<p>compute architectures in place</p>
<p>that can then enable use cases</p>
<p>that can be connected to each other</p>
<p>to be able to function.</p>
<p>That's how I view the metaverse is really</p>
<p>taking managing, you know, well file.</p>
<p>And then this is what excites me about it</p>
<p>because you know,</p>
<p>I've been in the carrier guy for years,</p>
<p>worked in the department in defense</p>
<p>and seen these ask.</p>
<p>And really what excites me is that</p>
<p>I'm able to see the realities of it now.</p>
<p>It's starting to come together.</p>
<p>It's starting to come to come together.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So in the use case and Anand mentioned,</p>
<p>you know, that is to</p>
<p>me will be intense data</p>
<p>and it has to work you know for first</p>
<p>responder use cases it just says important</p>
<p>in sort of the Department of Defense</p>
<p>and to me</p>
<p>will happen far more in terms</p>
<p>of, you know, hurricanes</p>
<p>and natural disasters</p>
<p>as compared to,</p>
<p>you know, wartime scenarios.</p>
<p>Could you could you guys imagine</p>
<p>an Amber Alert</p>
<p>that automatically sent drones up?</p>
<p>That would be so cool. And what? Be cool.</p>
<p>That's right.</p>
<p>We can find we can find children</p>
<p>that are lost or in our area.</p>
<p>We've had a lot of gray alerts or silver</p>
<p>alerts recently where all older people</p>
<p>have left and old folks home and got lost</p>
<p>and they found them.</p>
<p>But I'm having having</p>
<p>that kind of visibility is</p>
<p>I think there's a lot of benefit,</p>
<p>but a lot of people are going to say</p>
<p>there are this scary drones</p>
<p>flying around, taking pictures of people</p>
<p>and where's my privacy?</p>
<p>Work ethics.</p>
<p>A Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>But well what it yeah.</p>
<p>It's enabling technology, right?</p>
<p>What we do with that technology,</p>
<p>we've, that's another discussion</p>
<p>around policy that we do today.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Well in another really good use</p>
<p>case, it's training, right.</p>
<p>So there's across</p>
<p>kind of lots of different industries</p>
<p>in lots of lots of areas</p>
<p>within the government as well.</p>
<p>There's a huge advantage if you can create</p>
<p>as close to a reality sort</p>
<p>of training simulation</p>
<p>without actually putting the person</p>
<p>in under threat or without</p>
<p>you spending</p>
<p>some of the massive amounts of money</p>
<p>if you're trying to do like a</p>
<p>a real live training session.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>So, so the idea of using 5G along with</p>
<p>artificial intelligence,</p>
<p>along with modeling and simulation</p>
<p>and doing that with edge compute like</p>
<p>is enabled by the type of architectures.</p>
<p>If you put that all together with 5G,</p>
<p>there really</p>
<p>we are line of sight</p>
<p>for having a very realistic environment</p>
<p>so that you can actually train people</p>
<p>very, very effectively</p>
<p>and then you can do things like understand</p>
<p>how they're responding to it,</p>
<p>what are their biometrics where you know,</p>
<p>what really changes over that?</p>
<p>The course of that training</p>
<p>to to go into some world of enhancement</p>
<p>that we can't even talk about right now</p>
<p>with respect to helping people deal with</p>
<p>either complex test or complex situations.</p>
<p>So training, I think, is going to be</p>
<p>one of the places that we see everything</p>
<p>come together</p>
<p>first, right into some really remarkable</p>
<p>types of situations.</p>
<p>And and I think maybe Leland,</p>
<p>they haven't done a clear enough job</p>
<p>to explain how important</p>
<p>the edge compute element is of this.</p>
<p>Because as much as 5G</p>
<p>is an enablement,</p>
<p>much of this depends on 5G</p>
<p>connecting to a mac as a pose to 5G</p>
<p>going up to the cloud</p>
<p>because there is still a lot of physics</p>
<p>that come into play.</p>
<p>So if you need super low latency,</p>
<p>we're not talking about an architecture</p>
<p>that goes headset to the cloud, down</p>
<p>to a mac, then down to visualization.</p>
<p>You really need to go headset to the mac,</p>
<p>do your real time processing there</p>
<p>for what's important,</p>
<p>and then you can share data</p>
<p>through the cloud</p>
<p>for that real time experience.</p>
<p>You need that close couple that's well in.</p>
<p>And you know,</p>
<p>I've talked about this before.</p>
<p>We also have the capability of meshing</p>
<p>are absolutely mixed together</p>
<p>so I may never even send that data</p>
<p>to the cloud.</p>
<p>These Macs can do all the process</p>
<p>and analytics</p>
<p>that I need to out on the switch.</p>
<p>Right, which. Very much so. Yeah.</p>
<p>This could do things like smart cities,</p>
<p>smart buildings.</p>
<p>I mean, 5G is</p>
<p>is really kind of that enabling technology</p>
<p>with the concept of a mobile edge compute</p>
<p>device altogether coming together.</p>
<p>I think we're it's a perfect storm</p>
<p>to make huge changes in the industry now.</p>
<p>We just got to go do it.</p>
<p>Yeah, I always say that the</p>
<p>the story of the new networks</p>
<p>there's just shipping it compute.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>And we're connecting it</p>
<p>through wireless connectivity,</p>
<p>but we're really distributing</p>
<p>compute points across the landscape</p>
<p>where we can now have apps</p>
<p>sitting at the edge and enabling</p>
<p>use cases right.</p>
<p>So 1 to 1</p>
<p>and I'm not saying that this is a true 1</p>
<p>to 1, that</p>
<p>every distributed compute point</p>
<p>to have a wireless connection point.</p>
<p>Now, in some examples,</p>
<p>if you kind of think, think about</p>
<p>as kind of where</p>
<p>we're heading to compute wireless 1 to 1.</p>
<p>And the more you proliferate either</p>
<p>war, you're going to have the other one</p>
<p>no permanent with it.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>So with all these great use cases</p>
<p>that we've talked about,</p>
<p>what role does Intel play in 5G?</p>
<p>Are we just providing chips?</p>
<p>What what have we done to make</p>
<p>this really happen?</p>
<p>So when you look at what it means</p>
<p>to virtualize</p>
<p>a network, it's</p>
<p>really taking portions of the network,</p>
<p>making it software defined,</p>
<p>and then enabling an ecosystem to build</p>
<p>or to design on top of our L1 one.</p>
<p>And that's exactly what Intel has done.</p>
<p>If you look at 4G and and moving into 5G,</p>
<p>we've taken the functional blocks</p>
<p>of the RAN, right?</p>
<p>And we've allowed an ecosystem to build</p>
<p>use cases and capabilities on top of it.</p>
<p>You know, we've called it Flex Ran,</p>
<p>you know, we've taken</p>
<p>what is deemed to be the baseband,</p>
<p>the L2 L3 layer and enable</p>
<p>the have an ability for for for companies</p>
<p>to come in</p>
<p>and design their own baseband</p>
<p>architectures, virtualize it.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Not necessarily something that existed</p>
<p>within 4G, definitely did not exist in 3G</p>
<p>for 4G.</p>
<p>and then allows new players to come in</p>
<p>and build around</p>
<p>architectures on our L1 fi layer.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So we actually provided that</p>
<p>half of that common hardware across</p>
<p>all of is that how it works is</p>
<p>I mean, this was common,</p>
<p>it's different than proprietary hardware.</p>
<p>So we were the ones designing this common</p>
<p>hardware.</p>
<p>Is that the way to think about it?</p>
<p>So we did two things right</p>
<p>just real quick.</p>
<p>So we so what Leland was describing</p>
<p>is really the software side.</p>
<p>So when we talked about</p>
<p>all of these new entrants that were coming</p>
<p>in, they Intel writing the flex ram</p>
<p>reference architecture</p>
<p>made it much easier for new entrants</p>
<p>to pick that up as a starting point</p>
<p>and then finish what was needed</p>
<p>to have a full ran solution.</p>
<p>So Flex ran as an enabling on the</p>
<p>on the software side,</p>
<p>there's a whole other hardware story</p>
<p>that Leland hadn't got to it, so.</p>
<p>Right. Okay, sorry, Leland.</p>
<p>I was a little confused. So</p>
<p>hardware side, what do we got?</p>
<p>So set out more than 1 to 2</p>
<p>and to speak so to speak to that.</p>
<p>But in terms</p>
<p>of how the software side of the track and</p>
<p>not did not try to mess up things here</p>
<p>but in order to kind of finish up</p>
<p>with the ecosystem play was that scaling</p>
<p>and opening up the ability</p>
<p>for the ecosystem team to to build out</p>
<p>their own flavors of flex</p>
<p>ran their own flavors of the</p>
<p>the baseband proliferated</p>
<p>not only across the U.S.</p>
<p>but across the world.</p>
<p>There are so many new players now</p>
<p>that are taking flex ran and developing</p>
<p>ran solutions, countless,</p>
<p>countless players.</p>
<p>Now you can even take them now</p>
<p>into other business verticals.</p>
<p>You're seeing the same thing</p>
<p>you're seeing.</p>
<p>And often the departments sense</p>
<p>within the military vertical</p>
<p>you're seeing this off and first responder</p>
<p>verticals taking flex ran and evolve</p>
<p>and you know they're running solutions</p>
<p>based on our L1 five layer.</p>
<p>So we have an ecosystem</p>
<p>that is grown on top of our architecture</p>
<p>that is now providing the ability</p>
<p>to develop these new use cases.</p>
<p>And I, I have a question around that.</p>
<p>Does that include the, the old guard?</p>
<p>Because what you basically came in</p>
<p>and disrupted their industry.</p>
<p>And includes</p>
<p>the old guard that the old guard.</p>
<p>So the old guard bought into.</p>
<p>The old corporate by then.</p>
<p>Let's keep in mind</p>
<p>the old guard developed their solutions</p>
<p>and made a proprietary escena</p>
<p>in that test or business case,</p>
<p>the newer</p>
<p>players are coming in as well because</p>
<p>again, the point of entry is easier</p>
<p>as compared to what</p>
<p>the old guard developed the closed box.</p>
<p>Now this ability to</p>
<p>no to develop your own box, if you will.</p>
<p>Gotcha, if you will.</p>
<p>That makes more sense.</p>
<p>So there's still a lot of proprietary</p>
<p>brands out there</p>
<p>that are not based on Intel Flux.</p>
<p>Right. Right.</p>
<p>And those are in</p>
<p>some of the major players.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>But I think from a</p>
<p>how do you just open up a whole ecosystem</p>
<p>and give newer players</p>
<p>an advantage rights to really come in</p>
<p>without massive</p>
<p>development times to really be the</p>
<p>you know, to be a significant contributor?</p>
<p>Definitely.</p>
<p>Intel's play on Flex was all about that.</p>
<p>And then the parallel of</p>
<p>it was really on the hardware side, right?</p>
<p>So we was definitely the 5G expert.</p>
<p>I'm much more of the applications.</p>
<p>And how do you use things</p>
<p>that we've we really did</p>
<p>spend a lot of cycles</p>
<p>to make sure that our cots</p>
<p>hardware over the commercial off the shelf</p>
<p>hardware was going to work</p>
<p>really well to support all of the baseband</p>
<p>and RAM applications in certain.</p>
<p>That's another thing that's just like</p>
<p>make sure when you're walking away</p>
<p>from these proprietary systems</p>
<p>that those proprietary</p>
<p>the new systems are open</p>
<p>and are easily supported</p>
<p>by the same type of server that works</p>
<p>in the cloud and works in the data center,</p>
<p>because now you have the scale</p>
<p>and the cost advantage</p>
<p>and again, you're not going to just</p>
<p>a limited number of players and say,</p>
<p>you know, give me your hardware for my</p>
<p>you know, for my baseband.</p>
<p>You get to say, hey, that server</p>
<p>that you use across the board,</p>
<p>you can use it</p>
<p>in this case, too. And that's</p>
<p>hugely significant as well.</p>
<p>Just from a price and a scalability.</p>
<p>I was going to say that's going to drive</p>
<p>prices down.</p>
<p>It's going to drive more innovation</p>
<p>in the industry as a whole.</p>
<p>So kudos to Intel.</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>We need to give ourselves some kudos</p>
<p>for this, right?</p>
<p>I mean, we're building a big, huge</p>
<p>ecosystem</p>
<p>to enable more compute</p>
<p>everywhere in the world.</p>
<p>I in fact, it reminds me of</p>
<p>something that just happened.</p>
<p>And maybe you guys,</p>
<p>if you don't have any information on this,</p>
<p>T-Mobile</p>
<p>just signed some agreements with Space X.</p>
<p>Do you know about this one?</p>
<p>I do not.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>We're going to do some research.</p>
<p>I'll cut this out of the thing</p>
<p>because I'm like, whoa,</p>
<p>my phone will actually start</p>
<p>working in the middle of Nevada now.</p>
<p>Well, we'll have to wait and see.</p>
<p>Yeah, but keep this inside</p>
<p>the inside</p>
<p>the it's up to the air recording</p>
<p>space, you know, in the terrestrial</p>
<p>domain.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>We tend to look at it as separate.</p>
<p>But as time goes on,</p>
<p>because of what Intel has really begun,</p>
<p>you know, hardware, software,</p>
<p>the ability to scale is now for basically</p>
<p>for both domains</p>
<p>to look one in the same to us,</p>
<p>just like how wi fi and cellular looks one</p>
<p>in the same in your own imagined space.</p>
<p>And it's virtual conflict</p>
<p>and one in the same.</p>
<p>It should, right? Yeah. No, I love.</p>
