# Realizing Smart City Potential

*Smart Cities require infrastructure and financial resiliency. How infrastructure is
updated is just as important as how it will be paid for.*

Intel’s Darren Pulsipher, Chief Solutions Architect, Public Sector, talks with Eric Hornsby, CEO of SmartPoint.io, about SmartPoint’s technology and business model for realizing smart city potential.

In this episode, Darren talks with Eric Hornsby, CEO of SmartPoint.io, about technology for realizing smart city potential.

Eric had a long career in the data center and, more recently, in the digital signage space. His passions are project management and technology deployment and operation. Eric and his team were part of an LG Electronics joint venture company that deployed outdoor digital signage, primarily for advertising applications in dense urban areas, transit venues, and city streets. They learned a lot about other applications in those environments that compute resources and other forms of connectivity that would help enhance the experience brought on by IoT. SmartPoint.io was born out of that ecosystem and a desire to work with and drive opportunity and advancement in that market space.

In the data center, Eric was part of a lifecycle solutions company that helped companies optimize server storage and network hardware from an acquisition, a refresh cycle, and everything in between. His role was focused on helping the channel of companies that sold those solutions, but also how they were purchased, financed, and how they depreciated over time, so he learned not just about the technology but how people were using it and managing that value as an asset on their balance sheet.

When people talk about smart cities, they think of resilience, equity, efficiency, and cost-effectiveness. Cities provide essential services such as roads, public safety, water, and sewer. The primary thing a municipality brings to its citizens is starting to include connectivity, the ability to access computing, and taking advantage of technological advancements to help provide basic services more efficiently. Smart technology has been expensive and risky, and few municipal budgets have room for it.

Eric’s background in finance is an asset in creating and deploying smart city technology in a partnership that provides an affordable model. Being able to deploy the current significant funding for infrastructure projects in resilient and economically sustainable ways is a major tenet of what SmartPoint does when partnering with a city.

To achieve economic sustainability, Eric’s team took a hard look at digital signage, primarily for advertising, which generates a tremendous amount of revenue. Some of the largest companies in the world are primarily funded by advertising revenue, and one of the primary products or resources is the people to whom they are advertising. Layering attribution, customers’ traits, and likenesses increase revenue.

Cities have a treasure trove of value in the people, commercial entities, and visitors that reside within their real estate. So the core of what SmartPoint.io is doing is leveraging that real estate to generate revenue but directly aligning it with solutions that produce meaningful outcomes in city services. Getting this technology into the cities requires help from the private sector and willingness from the public sector to work together.

Advertising revenue, along with being able to tap into the budgets of city services, allows a financial model that raises the tide for all boats, from providing safer transportation to greater returns on advertising. When you tie the advertising benefit back to the people to whom the advertising is directed, you create a circular local economy that increases value and efficiency.

Edge computing is a significant part of SmartPoint.io’s product. The digital signage box is also like a portable data center. Data does not have to go back to a large data center somewhere but is processed at the edge. For example, video data from the ubiquitous cameras in a city to watch traffic patterns is bandwidth-intensive. Still, the data transport is significantly reduced if it is cached, stored, or processed locally.

Three great things about these boxes are that they do a great job of reducing latency, cost and increasing privacy. The privacy issue seems counterintuitive, but the video data, for example, is not traveling over public IP. Analysis happens at the point of capture, so it is not transported across the pipe, observed, or taken several hops where security needs to be tracked. Instead of the image, it sends the event “A person walking down the street.” This data can be scrubbed and anonymized much earlier in the analysis cycle before it leaves the box, protecting people’s privacy.

The boxes could also provide services such as Wi-Fi or 5G hotspots to underserved areas.

Once the boxes are deployed, SmartPoint.io has a team that monitors and operates the technology, just like a data center would for a company. They also partner with advertisers. Many advertisers are interested in migrating from static “paper poster” advertising to digital. SmartPoint.io is a great partner for those advertisers because they come with upfront CapEx funding.

With the cities, the model is revenue share or paid in kind. Instead of just sharing top-line revenue, however, SmarPoint.io produces and operates resources such as IT infrastructure that the city can then use to process optical data at the edge.

Digital signage can be interactive, which benefits people trying to find services, restaurants, shopping, events, and entertainment. Commercial tenants can use it as a portal for new economic development because they can reach the people walking around. In turn, the boxes give back valuable information, such as how many people were downtown or if an ad campaign successfully brought them there.

This model will help smart cities because it defers the cost of CapEx and the OpEx of managing the hardware out in the wild and the refresh cycles. Taking risks on expensive, relatively new technology is also not a normal behavior for a municipality, so partnering with the private sector with a significant appetite for risk, know-how, and funding helps the cities to mitigate the risks and costs and get further out in front of where they would be typically comfortable.

In the end, Eric says that successes are starting to build in this space, and they build on one another. Everyone is learning new things, and it’s an excellent opportunity to come together and build community, which is what cities are all about.

<p>﻿1</p>
<p>Hello, this</p>
<p>is Darren Pulsipher, chief solution</p>
<p>architect of public sector at Intel.</p>
<p>And welcome to Embracing</p>
<p>Digital Transformation,</p>
<p>where we investigate effective change,</p>
<p>leveraging people, process</p>
<p>and technology.</p>
<p>On today's episode, Realizing Smart Cities</p>
<p>Potential</p>
<p>with CEO from SmartPoint, Eric Hornsby.</p>
<p>Eric, welcome to the show.</p>
<p>Darren Thanks for having me.</p>
<p>Hey Eric, I got really excited</p>
<p>when I first heard about what you guys do</p>
<p>and when I talked to you</p>
<p>the first time, I says,</p>
<p>I got to have Eric on the show</p>
<p>because this is really cool.</p>
<p>What you've been doing.</p>
<p>But before we dove into the fun</p>
<p>stuff, well, this might be fun to give me</p>
<p>a little bit on your background.</p>
<p>Yeah. Happy to.</p>
<p>So I'm Eric Hornsby,</p>
<p>obviously with Smart Point.</p>
<p>I know I've got a long tenure</p>
<p>in the data center</p>
<p>and more recently, digital signage space.</p>
<p>We've been working with Intel Corporation</p>
<p>for quite some time,</p>
<p>have a very strategic relationship</p>
<p>there around</p>
<p>market ready solutions</p>
<p>and other go to markets</p>
<p>that we've benefited</p>
<p>from mutually with Intel.</p>
<p>But you know myself,</p>
<p>I have a lot of passions around</p>
<p>project management,</p>
<p>technology, deployment and operation,</p>
<p>all things that fall</p>
<p>within the bounds of Smart Point IO.</p>
<p>We as a team most recently</p>
<p>were part of an LG Electronics</p>
<p>joint venture company</p>
<p>where we deployed outdoor digital signage</p>
<p>primarily</p>
<p>for advertising applications</p>
<p>in dense urban areas, transit venues,</p>
<p>city streets, what have you.</p>
<p>And we learned a lot</p>
<p>about really other applications</p>
<p>in those environments that compute</p>
<p>resources and other forms of connect</p>
<p>tivity would help enhance the experience</p>
<p>brought on by the Internet of Things.</p>
<p>So smart point was really born</p>
<p>out of that ecosystem and, and a desire to</p>
<p>to work with that market space and drive</p>
<p>advancement and opportunity there.</p>
<p>Okay, Angela,</p>
<p>I'm going to hit on something</p>
<p>you said you started in the data center.</p>
<p>So right.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>What in the world</p>
<p>are you doing out in digital signage?</p>
<p>Because going from data center</p>
<p>into digital signage, those are like</p>
<p>diametrically opposed.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>So you got to tell me how you got there.</p>
<p>It was an interesting transition.</p>
<p>So I was part of a company that was a</p>
<p>what we would call a lifecycle management</p>
<p>or lifecycle solutions company</p>
<p>in the data center space.</p>
<p>So we helped companies optimize server</p>
<p>storage and network hardware from a</p>
<p>an acquisition and a refresh cycle</p>
<p>standpoint and everything in between.</p>
<p>And my role was very focused on helping</p>
<p>the channel</p>
<p>of companies that sold those solutions,</p>
<p>but also how they were purchased,</p>
<p>how they were financed and then how</p>
<p>those assets were depreciated over time.</p>
<p>So in that role, I learned quite a bit,</p>
<p>not just about the technology</p>
<p>we're selling, but</p>
<p>how people were using it and how they were</p>
<p>you know, really managing that that value</p>
<p>as an asset on their balance sheet.</p>
<p>Fast forward to</p>
<p>really 2015.</p>
<p>I had an opportunity to do some consulting</p>
<p>for a company</p>
<p>in the digital signage space.</p>
<p>They had just signed</p>
<p>a partnership agreement with LG</p>
<p>and with LG being a channel led</p>
<p>go to market company.</p>
<p>I was able to to help with some advice</p>
<p>and some market direction</p>
<p>there as well as standing up</p>
<p>some new financial</p>
<p>models that that company went</p>
<p>went to market with.</p>
<p>And you know, fast forward several years,</p>
<p>it turned into a</p>
<p>a full time opportunity that I was. Time.</p>
<p>Happy to accept and</p>
<p>the rest is history.</p>
<p>Okay, so you're the first finance guy</p>
<p>I've had.</p>
<p>Come on to see you now.</p>
<p>All right, so this would be</p>
<p>really interesting to hear that,</p>
<p>because you've come up with something</p>
<p>I think is really creative</p>
<p>with what you guys are doing.</p>
<p>And it is how do I actually make it</p>
<p>technology real in our cities.</p>
<p>We've been talking about smart cities</p>
<p>for, what, a decade?</p>
<p>You're right.</p>
<p>But the cost of it and managing it,</p>
<p>there's a lot involved</p>
<p>in really creating a real smart city</p>
<p>and using it.</p>
<p>I thought, I think it's pretty brilliant,</p>
<p>your financial background</p>
<p>and you understand all this stuff.</p>
<p>Tell me, tell me what vision you have</p>
<p>as far as smart cities go.</p>
<p>And because when you first mentioned this,</p>
<p>I was like blown away.</p>
<p>I thought it was pretty, pretty clever.</p>
<p>So when when</p>
<p>and there's a lot of talk of smart cities</p>
<p>and depending on or smart communities,</p>
<p>connected community infrastructure,</p>
<p>there's a lot of really synonymous terms.</p>
<p>But some of the major tenants you're</p>
<p>you're going to hear are smart.</p>
<p>Cities are resilient,</p>
<p>smart cities are equitable.</p>
<p>And, you know, they're really much like,</p>
<p>from my perspective, much like an I.T.</p>
<p>department would look at</p>
<p>how they're serving their company</p>
<p>to do to do better, to be more efficient,</p>
<p>cost effective, what have you help</p>
<p>a company</p>
<p>be resilient cities are very similar</p>
<p>from the public services</p>
<p>that they provide, whether those are roads</p>
<p>and bridges, public safety, environmental</p>
<p>cleanliness, what have you.</p>
<p>Sometimes</p>
<p>water, sewer, right, all those things.</p>
<p>So when we think about the base,</p>
<p>the basics that a municipality</p>
<p>brings to their citizens,</p>
<p>visitors, commercial tenants</p>
<p>as technologies, technology has evolved,</p>
<p>some of those basic</p>
<p>things are starting to include</p>
<p>connectivity and the ability</p>
<p>to access compute</p>
<p>and for different city services</p>
<p>to be able to take advantage</p>
<p>of advancements in technology</p>
<p>to do a better job of those same basic</p>
<p>you know, providing a safe, less congested</p>
<p>from a traffic standpoint, environment</p>
<p>that's also resilient.</p>
<p>So getting back to the financial</p>
<p>modeling resiliency from our perspective</p>
<p>also needs to mean</p>
<p>economic sustainability.</p>
<p>We're in a a an amazing time</p>
<p>right now,</p>
<p>a historic time in terms of funding</p>
<p>that's being made available</p>
<p>for infrastructure projects as a.</p>
<p>Like from IJA. Right.</p>
<p>And being able to deploy that funding</p>
<p>in ways that is resilient</p>
<p>and economically sustainable is a major</p>
<p>tenet of what smart points doing</p>
<p>when we partner.</p>
<p>You're looking at financial resilience,</p>
<p>which no one ever looks at.</p>
<p>I've never heard financial resilience</p>
<p>in the IT space before, but I</p>
<p>like I like this approach because I can</p>
<p>I can throw hardware.</p>
<p>And I, you know, I work at Intel.</p>
<p>I want everyone to refresh your hardware</p>
<p>every three years.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>But realistically, that's not doable</p>
<p>with the budgets that cities have</p>
<p>or states have to do that.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>We we took a real hard look at the space</p>
<p>that we were previously in,</p>
<p>which was very narrow in digital signage,</p>
<p>primarily for advertising.</p>
<p>And there's a tremendous amount of revenue</p>
<p>generated in that market space.</p>
<p>We all know some of the largest companies</p>
<p>in the world are primarily funded</p>
<p>by advertising revenue.</p>
<p>Yeah, Google, for example, for example.</p>
<p>And, and, you know, one of the primary,</p>
<p>you know, products or resources,</p>
<p>there are the people</p>
<p>who are being advertised</p>
<p>to their information,</p>
<p>their likeness, their traits.</p>
<p>And and these, you know, layer on</p>
<p>what's called attribution,</p>
<p>which increases the value</p>
<p>of the advertising making more money.</p>
<p>So taking a look at that as a focus</p>
<p>revenue stream or ROI</p>
<p>for cities to harness, cities have a</p>
<p>a treasure trove of value</p>
<p>in the real estate and the people</p>
<p>and the commercial entities and visitors</p>
<p>that reside within that real estate.</p>
<p>So being able to more effectively leverage</p>
<p>that real estate</p>
<p>to generate revenue</p>
<p>but align it directly with</p>
<p>solutions</p>
<p>that produce outcomes that are meaningful</p>
<p>to what the city should be</p>
<p>providing to its citizens, visitors</p>
<p>and commercial tenants is really at</p>
<p>the core of what we're doing</p>
<p>and being on board to operate a network</p>
<p>like that and manage</p>
<p>that from a not just a technology,</p>
<p>but a financial operations</p>
<p>standpoint is is really</p>
<p>what's getting it's getting cities</p>
<p>more to a point where they can</p>
<p>not just comfortably but confidently</p>
<p>move forward with with projects that are</p>
<p>that are meaningful and substantial.</p>
<p>To your point, how do we get this</p>
<p>technology out into the city?</p>
<p>It requires help from the private sector</p>
<p>and it requires a willingness</p>
<p>to work together from the public sector.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>So explain. Exactly.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>So I like I like the idea. Right.</p>
<p>How can we get hardware,</p>
<p>new technologies into the cities?</p>
<p>But it's costly. So we can.</p>
<p>You're saying that we can fund it</p>
<p>actually through advertising?</p>
<p>Is that the.</p>
<p>Concept?</p>
<p>Advertising's</p>
<p>a major source of the revenue.</p>
<p>Other sources are that cities spend</p>
<p>a tremendous amount of money to provide</p>
<p>the basic services that are delivered</p>
<p>by a municipality to its citizens.</p>
<p>So being able to tap into those budgets</p>
<p>as well allows for a financial model</p>
<p>that really raises</p>
<p>the tide across all those boats</p>
<p>from providing safer transportation</p>
<p>to, you know, greater</p>
<p>returns on advertising.</p>
<p>When you can tie the the advertising</p>
<p>benefit</p>
<p>back to the people who are advertising to.</p>
<p>That's what gets us really excited</p>
<p>and gets us and gets the city interested</p>
<p>because you are creating a</p>
<p>a circular economy that allows for that</p>
<p>that resource in the people</p>
<p>in the real estate</p>
<p>to be harvesting</p>
<p>that value more efficiently.</p>
<p>So it's almost it's almost like keeping it</p>
<p>more local in a lot of respects, right?</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>Which is which is pretty cool</p>
<p>because now I can keep that</p>
<p>that economy in my in my city growing</p>
<p>instead of it growing outside of my city.</p>
<p>Yes, that's the idea.</p>
<p>It's pretty cool.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>So explain the explain</p>
<p>the technology a little bit.</p>
<p>We got a little bit of the business model.</p>
<p>Explain</p>
<p>what does this look like physically?</p>
<p>So going from a data center background,</p>
<p>which is very centralized</p>
<p>in nature to a digital signage</p>
<p>on sidewalks, it's very decentralized.</p>
<p>So definite opposite ends of the spectrum.</p>
<p>And combining what we do from a technology</p>
<p>standpoint is really combining</p>
<p>operational technology,</p>
<p>which definition would would fall</p>
<p>into really things that you're touching,</p>
<p>seeing, you know, experience.</p>
<p>Like physical, physical</p>
<p>things you're interacting. Right?</p>
<p>We were combining that with with I.T</p>
<p>information</p>
<p>technology that you normally wouldn't see,</p>
<p>but having it there.</p>
<p>And the reason we're doing</p>
<p>that is because this explosive growth</p>
<p>in the Internet of Things and data</p>
<p>being produced at the physical edge</p>
<p>of the network creates an opportunity</p>
<p>for the physical edge of the network</p>
<p>to be a place</p>
<p>where computation takes place.</p>
<p>So that data not having to go all the way</p>
<p>back to a large data center</p>
<p>somewhere,</p>
<p>the workload would be processed.</p>
<p>And then that insight from whatever</p>
<p>you know you're trying to garner</p>
<p>has to be sent</p>
<p>all the way back to the edge.</p>
<p>You can you can do it right there.</p>
<p>Again, keeping it local</p>
<p>as a as a tenet of what we're doing.</p>
<p>But edge computing is a major part of our</p>
<p>our product.</p>
<p>And utilizing that edge computing</p>
<p>to produce outcomes</p>
<p>for things that are focused</p>
<p>on doing better at the edge.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So what I just heard was your digital</p>
<p>signage is not just a pretty bar,</p>
<p>a pretty box with advertising on it.</p>
<p>Yeah, I can actually run compute in those,</p>
<p>in those digital signs</p>
<p>that you have on the sidewalk.</p>
<p>That is correct. Yes.</p>
<p>So it's like a portable data center.</p>
<p>Does anyone like throw it in the back</p>
<p>of their truck and take off with it?</p>
<p>You need to have planned</p>
<p>pretty far in advance.</p>
<p>They're pretty far invested. Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah, we we've over the course of the past</p>
<p>six, six or seven years,</p>
<p>we've deployed tens of thousands</p>
<p>of these around the world</p>
<p>for digital signage purposes.</p>
<p>But we've gotten pretty good at making</p>
<p>sure they stay where they.</p>
<p>Stay, and that's good.</p>
<p>So what sorts of workloads can I run</p>
<p>in these digital science signage boxes?</p>
<p>So one of the the types of data</p>
<p>that we talk about a lot is video data.</p>
<p>So there's there's cameras everywhere.</p>
<p>And cameras are watching for things</p>
<p>like abnormalities in traffic patterns.</p>
<p>They're looking at cars.</p>
<p>They're analyzing how many bicycles</p>
<p>are on the road with the cars and,</p>
<p>you know, focusing on</p>
<p>how could we make things safer or better.</p>
<p>And there's</p>
<p>but optical data from video</p>
<p>is is extremely bandwidth intensive.</p>
<p>And so trying to as</p>
<p>anybody knows that strive to stream</p>
<p>something on their mobile device.</p>
<p>You need to have a great connection</p>
<p>to to pull that off.</p>
<p>But if you could you could cache that</p>
<p>you could store that video</p>
<p>or process it locally.</p>
<p>Then you've reduced the amount of data</p>
<p>transport</p>
<p>necessary to garner an outcome.</p>
<p>So running computer vision</p>
<p>analytics at the edge</p>
<p>is one of the things that we</p>
<p>we do quite a bit of.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>So that decreases</p>
<p>the total bandwidth that you need</p>
<p>because you're not going to stream 4K</p>
<p>video anymore.</p>
<p>You're just streaming</p>
<p>object data that you've detected. Yep.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>So, so that gives me traffic</p>
<p>pattern flows.</p>
<p>That gives me weather,</p>
<p>right?</p>
<p>There's a whole bunch of things</p>
<p>that these boxes can then you use.</p>
<p>It's basically a Iot node out there</p>
<p>that can do</p>
<p>a lot of different things.</p>
<p>If we had to break it down to three,</p>
<p>three things, I would say</p>
<p>it does a great job of reducing latency.</p>
<p>So it should be the time it takes to</p>
<p>to move that data</p>
<p>processor and produce the insight.</p>
<p>Just and that's just simple physics,</p>
<p>right?</p>
<p>Less less distance for it to travel</p>
<p>that that same outcome reduces cost</p>
<p>because you're not having to transport</p>
<p>that data</p>
<p>as far.</p>
<p>And the third really hones in on privacy.</p>
<p>So being able to.</p>
<p>Do I would have thought the opposite</p>
<p>there.</p>
<p>I would have thought,</p>
<p>what's your privacy thing on this?</p>
<p>Because, oh,</p>
<p>I got a camera watching everyone</p>
<p>and so what's your privacy angle on this?</p>
<p>But again.</p>
<p>It's counterintuitive to me.</p>
<p>Being being able to use that camera data.</p>
<p>I'll call it behind the radio</p>
<p>so it's not traveling over public IP</p>
<p>allows for analysis</p>
<p>at the point of capture.</p>
<p>So we're not we're not sending pictures</p>
<p>of Eric Hornsby</p>
<p>across the pipe back to a data center</p>
<p>somewhere or being observed</p>
<p>and having several hops, let's call it</p>
<p>where security needs to be tracked.</p>
<p>Instead, it's saying there's a guy</p>
<p>walking down the street.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>And the data is able to be scrubbed.</p>
<p>They're anonymized much earlier</p>
<p>in that analysis cycle.</p>
<p>Before it even leaves the box. Yep.</p>
<p>Very cool.</p>
<p>Now, what else can I do with these things?</p>
<p>We talked a little bit about.</p>
<p>I can put like a 5G,</p>
<p>I can turn this into a 5G hotspot</p>
<p>or a Wi-Fi hotspot as well, right?</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So again, it's it's working with cities</p>
<p>to identify what commercial revenue</p>
<p>streams, you know, could we generate</p>
<p>together at these real estate end points?</p>
<p>And how could we operate a project</p>
<p>from a financial standpoint</p>
<p>that also brings</p>
<p>to bear different technologies like 5G</p>
<p>you just mentioned, or a Seabreeze</p>
<p>or wi fi.</p>
<p>There's lots of</p>
<p>we call them underserved areas</p>
<p>that would love to have better</p>
<p>connectivity.</p>
<p>The cities would love to provide</p>
<p>that as a basic deliverable</p>
<p>from the municipal key.</p>
<p>And those are things that we bundle into.</p>
<p>These these projects.</p>
<p>Are very cool now.</p>
<p>All right. So how does this work?</p>
<p>Because we talked about this</p>
<p>a little bit before the show.</p>
<p>How does it work?</p>
<p>If I'm a municipality, I contact you guys.</p>
<p>You go and deploy these signs</p>
<p>in down my main, main street.</p>
<p>Folsom once was where I live.</p>
<p>Folsom, California, Main Street.</p>
<p>Folsom</p>
<p>We put like three or four of these up</p>
<p>and I know</p>
<p>as the city, I maintain these things,</p>
<p>I get the advertisers.</p>
<p>Or is it a joint venture with you guys?</p>
<p>How does how does operationally</p>
<p>how does it work for me?</p>
<p>Because it sounds like I'm going to have</p>
<p>to staff up people that understand Iot</p>
<p>and data center and maintain these things.</p>
<p>So we have a team</p>
<p>that monitors and operates the technology</p>
<p>just like a data center</p>
<p>would for a company.</p>
<p>We so we are the operator</p>
<p>and we work with the city.</p>
<p>So where the city would have had</p>
<p>departments that are leveraging</p>
<p>i.t infrastructure perhaps somewhere else.</p>
<p>Now our joint project becomes</p>
<p>that i.t infrastructure</p>
<p>that they are they can use</p>
<p>from an advertising perspective.</p>
<p>We partner with the existing out of home</p>
<p>media advertisers.</p>
<p>So there's lots of incumbents out there</p>
<p>who are very interested</p>
<p>in upgrading their technology</p>
<p>or migrating from what's called static</p>
<p>paper poster advertising to digital.</p>
<p>And we're a great partner</p>
<p>for for that in its own right</p>
<p>because we come in with all of the upfront</p>
<p>CapEx funding, we deploy the technology.</p>
<p>And now instead of selling a static poster</p>
<p>advertisement, the ad incumbent</p>
<p>advertiser has the opportunity to work</p>
<p>with us and to start selling digital.</p>
<p>So it's a great opportunity for a refresh</p>
<p>and a significant upgrade to the incumbent</p>
<p>out of the companies out there.</p>
<p>So so the silver screen.</p>
<p>So if I'm a city now and I decide, hey,</p>
<p>we we really want to do this</p>
<p>digital signage, there's so many questions</p>
<p>in my head right now.</p>
<p>One is you guys you guys are</p>
<p>you guys are now like a normal billboard,</p>
<p>just a digital sign.</p>
<p>So you're getting the revenue from the</p>
<p>advertising that's going on there,</p>
<p>right?</p>
<p>The city is allowing you to put that</p>
<p>there and they're getting some kind of</p>
<p>something, I'm sure,</p>
<p>whether it's cycles on, you know,</p>
<p>how do I put my applications on there?</p>
<p>That because you said, hey,</p>
<p>you said we can use the data center</p>
<p>part of this to do things.</p>
<p>How do I pay for that</p>
<p>or do I get a cut of that?</p>
<p>How does that all work for</p>
<p>just does that make any sense?</p>
<p>What I'm trying to get to are sure.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So the term that's often used, I'm</p>
<p>going to give you two terms.</p>
<p>One is simple, it's revenue share.</p>
<p>So when I hear the. Revenue share,</p>
<p>all right.</p>
<p>When I hear</p>
<p>how do we get a cut of a revenue</p>
<p>share has been around for a long time</p>
<p>and that's.</p>
<p>An easy one for people to understand. Yep.</p>
<p>But the other term is paid in kind</p>
<p>and paid in</p>
<p>kind will often be,</p>
<p>I would call it, a form of revenue share.</p>
<p>But instead of sharing</p>
<p>just top line revenue that's thrown off</p>
<p>from the project, we produce</p>
<p>and operate resources</p>
<p>like I.T infrastructure</p>
<p>that the city can then use</p>
<p>to process optical data at the edge.</p>
<p>And that has an outcome</p>
<p>that the city's desiring to see.</p>
<p>Okay, so that's, that's pretty cool.</p>
<p>So here's, here's a scenario</p>
<p>that I think I would love to see downtown</p>
<p>Folsom again,</p>
<p>that Wi-Fi is available for everyone</p>
<p>downtown Folsom</p>
<p>because that would be really cool</p>
<p>if it's right on.</p>
<p>On the weekends,</p>
<p>they close down the main street</p>
<p>and there's lots of fun things</p>
<p>out there in restaurants</p>
<p>and it'd be great if Wi-Fi was available</p>
<p>for all of downtown.</p>
<p>So in this scenario,</p>
<p>I put maybe four or five of your digital</p>
<p>signage is down there paid in-kind means.</p>
<p>You're going to you're going to make sure</p>
<p>that I have Wi-Fi, that we put the Wi-Fi</p>
<p>service in in the in the box and that it's</p>
<p>available to everyone downtown.</p>
<p>And I'm ready to go out.</p>
<p>And simple and wi fi,</p>
<p>I mean, requires a backhaul.</p>
<p>So you need to have</p>
<p>a fiber circuit terminated.</p>
<p>So that's something that we stand up,</p>
<p>we pay the ongoing cost of access</p>
<p>to that fiber backbone</p>
<p>as a effectively an edge ISP for the city.</p>
<p>So we'll monitor, maintain and</p>
<p>and cover the cost of that.</p>
<p>But we do that with the revenues</p>
<p>that are generated</p>
<p>by the digital signage</p>
<p>that we're deploying.</p>
<p>So that's it's a great example</p>
<p>and a simple example.</p>
<p>Here's another question I have.</p>
<p>Is your digital signage interactive?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So could I have a map</p>
<p>so I can have a map of downtown on there?</p>
<p>That would be standard.</p>
<p>The vendors in downtown</p>
<p>would put their little logos up there, as,</p>
<p>you know, like like you'd see</p>
<p>like an airport, for example.</p>
<p>I can say I need to find a restaurant</p>
<p>quick because,</p>
<p>you know, I'm starving on my layover.</p>
<p>Sure. Yeah.</p>
<p>So absolutely.</p>
<p>They have a touch screen interactivity.</p>
<p>There's applications called wayfinding</p>
<p>is the commonly used term where</p>
<p>if you know, easy</p>
<p>to find city services, restaurants,</p>
<p>other retail shopping nearby.</p>
<p>So they're very useful for that.</p>
<p>And then, of course,</p>
<p>offering access to that via</p>
<p>a portal to the city</p>
<p>and to the commercial tenants there</p>
<p>it opens up a new opportunity</p>
<p>for economic development.</p>
<p>For that local economy to reach</p>
<p>to reach the people walking around.</p>
<p>No, I see.</p>
<p>I'm already thinking calendar of events,</p>
<p>all that stuff would show</p>
<p>would show up right there.</p>
<p>Yeah. That's that's. Entertainment.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It definitely becomes the new digital, you</p>
<p>know, billboard, if you will, for events</p>
<p>and things that people want to go see,</p>
<p>what's new, what announcements are there.</p>
<p>It's a way for the city</p>
<p>to better engage with people.</p>
<p>Well and also gives me</p>
<p>valuable information back, right.</p>
<p>Because let's say I want to count</p>
<p>how many people are downtown this weekend.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>And maybe I did some advertising</p>
<p>for some event downtown.</p>
<p>I want to see what my take was</p>
<p>as far as not take or see</p>
<p>with the effectiveness of my campaign</p>
<p>was to bring people downtown.</p>
<p>These these cameras could easily count</p>
<p>how many people were downtown.</p>
<p>That was an easy thing for them to do.</p>
<p>There's so much potential here.</p>
<p>I love the model of</p>
<p>because one of the biggest problems</p>
<p>that we've seen with smart</p>
<p>cities is the cost of CapEx.</p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p>And also the optics of managing</p>
<p>managing this hardware</p>
<p>once it's out in the wild,</p>
<p>that's a big cost to cities.</p>
<p>And then the refresh cycle.</p>
<p>This is another I want you to and Eric,</p>
<p>I know you're going to refresh</p>
<p>every every three years because</p>
<p>we're going to have great technology</p>
<p>and you're going to want it.</p>
<p>So I know you're going to I know</p>
<p>you want our stuff every three years.</p>
<p>The city, they're</p>
<p>they're under much more constraints</p>
<p>as far as as far as that goes.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Well and you know refresh cycle</p>
<p>I'll segway that into one of the</p>
<p>one of the challenges with</p>
<p>I would say new industry.</p>
<p>So Iot is still relatively new.</p>
<p>Certainly Iot at the edge is is new</p>
<p>and investing in technology at the stage,</p>
<p>you'd fall into what I'd call</p>
<p>an early adopter category.</p>
<p>Oh, it's expensive. Yeah, it's.</p>
<p>Well, it's expensive and there's,</p>
<p>there's risk and anybody who deals</p>
<p>with municipalities would, would know that</p>
<p>they, they would prefer to de-risk what.</p>
<p>They're doing because. Yeah, you.</p>
<p>Know, and so take taking a chance</p>
<p>on very expensive</p>
<p>things doesn't always fall</p>
<p>into typical behavior of a city.</p>
<p>So again, this is where</p>
<p>partnering with the private sector,</p>
<p>where there is significant</p>
<p>appetite for risk and knowhow</p>
<p>of how to operate infrastructure</p>
<p>to gain reward is a great fit</p>
<p>for municipalities to to to hedge</p>
<p>hedge their bets a little bit</p>
<p>and to get out further out in front of</p>
<p>where they may have been comfortable</p>
<p>investing on their own.</p>
<p>Now, I, I love the model.</p>
<p>I think it's ingenious</p>
<p>because it may just be the way</p>
<p>that we can get smart cities to be real</p>
<p>because there's so much potential to</p>
<p>to having smart cities out there.</p>
<p>I love the financial model.</p>
<p>I think</p>
<p>I think it's pretty clever. So nice.</p>
<p>But it's there's also it's a</p>
<p>it's a great community out there.</p>
<p>There's a lot of great events put on.</p>
<p>We were just at the</p>
<p>the Smart City Expo in Miami.</p>
<p>And there's there's a lot of passion</p>
<p>from these cities to trade information</p>
<p>and share successes, learnings,</p>
<p>what have you.</p>
<p>And so for us, when we're</p>
<p>when we're talking to a city directly,</p>
<p>we typically have two,</p>
<p>maybe three topics we want to cover.</p>
<p>The first is really looking at</p>
<p>how how could we make</p>
<p>the initiative,</p>
<p>you know, financially sustainable?</p>
<p>You've heard me say that a lot. Oh,</p>
<p>yeah, yeah. No.</p>
<p>But then every city we've talked to has.</p>
<p>Something.</p>
<p>Something unique</p>
<p>that they're trying to solve for now.</p>
<p>No different</p>
<p>than when you call on businesses.</p>
<p>And yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>There's always some little thing</p>
<p>that's unique to them.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So finding, finding what that unique thing</p>
<p>is, that is top of mind</p>
<p>that they need to solve for</p>
<p>and they think there may be a way that's,</p>
<p>that's usually where our focus lies.</p>
<p>And then the third would likely be sharing</p>
<p>a success from another municipality.</p>
<p>But you could see has, as you know,</p>
<p>successes, you know, build on one another.</p>
<p>So it's it's an interesting market space</p>
<p>where we're learning new things, but</p>
<p>it's an opportunity for coming together</p>
<p>and and to build community,</p>
<p>which is really what cities are about.</p>
<p>Well, I'll tell you</p>
<p>what, Eric,</p>
<p>when you guys are the new Google Variety,</p>
<p>because I think the is pretty clever</p>
<p>and I think it has a lot of potential</p>
<p>to really grow this industry,</p>
<p>which has been stagnant.</p>
<p>Frankly, we've been there's a lot of hope.</p>
<p>But as you said, the barriers to entry</p>
<p>because of the risk of new technology</p>
<p>and cost and OpEx and CapEx, I think is</p>
<p>limiting its progression moving forward.</p>
<p>And I like that you guys actually came up</p>
<p>with a really cool solution</p>
<p>to tackle this, a business solution</p>
<p>to a technical problem.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>So thanks a lot,</p>
<p>Eric, for coming on the show.</p>
<p>I appreciate the time.</p>
