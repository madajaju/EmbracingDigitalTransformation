They identified four areas that have helped them not only survive but excel during this unusual time: Anticipate your manager's needs, Communicate like your job depends on it (because it for sure does), Wave your flag by waving the flag for others, Block! That! Calendar!

## Anticipate your manager's needs

* Guess what reporting your manager needs and have the information at your fingertips.
* Sales reports, project status, and customer status should be proactively created.

## Communicate like your job depends on it (because it for sure does)

* Do not fill other's email box with useless information
* Put your ask at the beginning of the email. Then add backup information.
* Give your team a summary of what you are doing with helpful information.

## Wave your flag by waving the flag for others

* A key component of success at any company is having visible, tangible accomplishments.
* You cannot always put your head down and work and hope it speaks for itself.
* Recognize others that helped you close the deal or finish the project.

## Block! That! Calendar!

* Set boundaries for family time and when work ends and begins.
* Block off time for "you" time. You need time to rest your brain.
* Set 5-10 minutes break between meetings,
* Time to process your inbox
* Time at the end of the day to process your day
