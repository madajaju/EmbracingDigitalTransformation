<p>Hello, this</p>
<p>is Darren Pulsipher chief solution</p>
<p>architect of public sector at Intel.</p>
<p>And welcome to Embracing</p>
<p>Digital Transformation,</p>
<p>where we investigate effective change,</p>
<p>leveraging</p>
<p>people, process and technology.</p>
<p>On today's episode identity</p>
<p>based micro segmentation.</p>
<p>Part two of my interview with Elisity.</p>
<p>What's the new approach here?</p>
<p>Because and Dan,</p>
<p>you and I have talked actually quite a bit</p>
<p>about the impacts of network</p>
<p>security on OT networks.</p>
<p>But before we go down that rabbit hole,</p>
<p>let's let's help people understand</p>
<p>what other options do I have?</p>
<p>And this is where I was impressed</p>
<p>with your guys's approach, which,</p>
<p>which you guys called identity</p>
<p>network security.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Or identity based micro segmentation,</p>
<p>least privileged access architectures?</p>
<p>I did.</p>
<p>It has a big what you guys got.</p>
<p>I like what's.</p>
<p>What's the acronym for that. Yeah.</p>
<p>I thought of in there.</p>
<p>We should get one thing.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Hey, you got to have a good acronym</p>
<p>for that one.</p>
<p>Identity based.</p>
<p>IBM s identity. Based.</p>
<p>IBM's and. IBM. Has</p>
<p>their own security.</p>
<p>It's something like LP and Privilege</p>
<p>Access.</p>
<p>Well, it was cool</p>
<p>when you guys explained it to me. So</p>
<p>let's start at the basics</p>
<p>because this is pretty deep stuff, right?</p>
<p>So what's your</p>
<p>what's your biggest differentiator?</p>
<p>What's your different approach</p>
<p>to network security?</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, it's it's all about well,</p>
<p>it's a couple of things, right?</p>
<p>There's there's how it's delivered,</p>
<p>how it's distributed around</p>
<p>across the network</p>
<p>and how this can be done</p>
<p>efficiently, effectively and provide</p>
<p>rapid time to value.</p>
<p>That's what we've been focused on, making</p>
<p>this as simple but effective as possible.</p>
<p>And intuitive so that really anybody</p>
<p>in any segment of the</p>
<p>of the environment</p>
<p>or a segment of the industry</p>
<p>can leverage this technology,</p>
<p>whether you're in the OT space or</p>
<p>in the IOT space, medical space,</p>
<p>EMT devices, it doesn't matter too.</p>
<p>To us.</p>
<p>These are all just important assets</p>
<p>to the organization we need to secure.</p>
<p>But I think we've been talking a lot</p>
<p>about micro segmentation.</p>
<p>We keep using this terms.</p>
<p>Maybe we should talk about what really</p>
<p>what that means to Elisity</p>
<p>and then that will help frame</p>
<p>how we approach the problem.</p>
<p>So so what is micro segmentation</p>
<p>from your guys's perspective?</p>
<p>Because I think I know what it means,</p>
<p>but you guys blew that away</p>
<p>with, you know, VLANs and</p>
<p>and firewalls is too complex to set up.</p>
<p>So what do you guys mean</p>
<p>by micro segmentation?</p>
<p>Yeah, that's a great question,</p>
<p>because micro segmentation</p>
<p>can mean a lot of different things</p>
<p>to different people.</p>
<p>The same way that word, zero trust</p>
<p>can mean a lot of things</p>
<p>to a lot of different people.</p>
<p>But I mean, micro segmentation,</p>
<p>for example,</p>
<p>in the data center</p>
<p>might mean the ability to separate</p>
<p>layers of applications</p>
<p>or workloads from each other and something</p>
<p>completely different in the space</p>
<p>and something different the Iot space.</p>
<p>But micro segmentation to elicited</p>
<p>is the capability</p>
<p>to completely isolate</p>
<p>any type of user device or application.</p>
<p>No matter what type of network it's</p>
<p>on, where it's placed in the network,</p>
<p>whether it's managed or unmanaged.</p>
<p>To us, it's the complete flexibility</p>
<p>to isolate one asset</p>
<p>from another without restrictions</p>
<p>imposed by network architecture</p>
<p>or network constructs like VLANs or V</p>
<p>or FS, which are super rigid</p>
<p>things that are that we get stuck on.</p>
<p>So then the question</p>
<p>that you're probably asking that</p>
<p>what next is how does eliciting set it up?</p>
<p>How do we handle it right?</p>
<p>And that's a big part of the challenge</p>
<p>that we've been solving for</p>
<p>historically micro segmentation.</p>
<p>No matter what platform you were trying</p>
<p>to deploy it on or configure it</p>
<p>on, require a lot of networking knowledge,</p>
<p>tons of planning most of the time.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Hardware replacement</p>
<p>or on prem appliance instantiation</p>
<p>and this is stalling</p>
<p>the time to value for customers</p>
<p>are they need a solution now</p>
<p>not six months from now when you get it up</p>
<p>and running it usually</p>
<p>it takes months, two years</p>
<p>to get any value out of the traditional</p>
<p>or a lot of the solutions</p>
<p>that are out there</p>
<p>that are being advertised</p>
<p>to provide this functionality.</p>
<p>And that doesn't fly</p>
<p>unless he's found great success</p>
<p>by shifting to a cloud native</p>
<p>and cloud delivered microsite mentation</p>
<p>platform.</p>
<p>You've probably heard this before.</p>
<p>ISDN solutions like Meraki.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, yeah. Like Meraki or Tela.</p>
<p>I'm originally from Telco down</p>
<p>and worked with the Taliban Cisco,</p>
<p>when for a long time</p>
<p>we understand how powerful this cloud</p>
<p>delivered software defined networking</p>
<p>solution is for anything for security.</p>
<p>In this case, it just scales really well.</p>
<p>It's easy to manage</p>
<p>distributed dynamically.</p>
<p>And so our our entire control</p>
<p>management</p>
<p>and policy plane is fully cloud delivered.</p>
<p>And the eliciting component</p>
<p>that ties to your on</p>
<p>prem network is 100% software,</p>
<p>and it's a lightweight software.</p>
<p>So we've made this incredibly easy</p>
<p>to deploy and configure.</p>
<p>There's nothing</p>
<p>you have to really change on prem.</p>
<p>It rides on</p>
<p>top of your existing infrastructure.</p>
<p>There's no hardware to change to replace,</p>
<p>and it makes it easier to</p>
<p>get up and running.</p>
<p>And you can write your policy</p>
<p>and apply it within a week.</p>
<p>So that sounds a lot to me because I work</p>
<p>in the container ecosystem quite a bit,</p>
<p>so and I already know the answer,</p>
<p>but I know my, my,</p>
<p>my listeners are going to think,</p>
<p>Oh, you guys created something like Calico</p>
<p>an overlay network,</p>
<p>but it's not that.</p>
<p>Go ahead.</p>
<p>Yeah, go ahead.</p>
<p>Then I was</p>
<p>I was kind of in the sense of we,</p>
<p>we delivered in a sense, it's</p>
<p>called a microservice and to tap on to it.</p>
<p>And so we're going to talk a little o.t</p>
<p>today is everything Dana just described</p>
<p>is also on prem</p>
<p>is that we started in the cloud,</p>
<p>but knowing that, you know, a lot of</p>
<p>listener is going to be in the area,</p>
<p>everything we actually had a few customers</p>
<p>that said, hey,</p>
<p>we love what you're doing,</p>
<p>but we need that behind L 3.5.</p>
<p>We need that behind the DMZ.</p>
<p>We need to be able to cut off all access</p>
<p>and we've delivered that too as well.</p>
<p>And so everything</p>
<p>Dana mentioned is completely accurate,</p>
<p>in addition to the fact on prem or cloud,</p>
<p>we can both have both offerings.</p>
<p>You good point.</p>
<p>But from a from a function perspective.</p>
<p>Yeah containerization is there</p>
<p>you could the easiest</p>
<p>representation is a microservice</p>
<p>in the sense of horizontally scalable.</p>
<p>So you start small you add 10,000</p>
<p>things to the in the network</p>
<p>and we just scale with you and</p>
<p>whether that be on prem or in the cloud.</p>
<p>Yeah, but, but the difference</p>
<p>between what you guys do</p>
<p>and what I've seen with overlay networks,</p>
<p>overlay networks are still dealing with.</p>
<p>Right. Yeah. Your how.</p>
<p>You guys don't you guys only deal with.</p>
<p>Control.</p>
<p>I like to say the policy plane as well.</p>
<p>I love that you brought this up</p>
<p>because it's a massive differentiator.</p>
<p>It's something we're really proud</p>
<p>about that</p>
<p>we're able to apply the same level</p>
<p>of granularity when it comes to network</p>
<p>security without touching a single</p>
<p>one of your packets.</p>
<p>And we were injected in the network</p>
<p>in that we can see</p>
<p>the metadata of identity</p>
<p>of all the flows in the network,</p>
<p>and then that information</p>
<p>is sent up to our cloud engine,</p>
<p>which can then figure out</p>
<p>what policy you'd be applied</p>
<p>and push it push that policy</p>
<p>down to the edge of your network</p>
<p>without actually touching your packet.</p>
<p>We use your existing infrastructure,</p>
<p>whether that's catalyst 9000 series</p>
<p>switches or Catalyst 3850 Series,</p>
<p>which is another host of vendors</p>
<p>that we're bringing to the market</p>
<p>now that we're going to support.</p>
<p>We're using that native functionality</p>
<p>on that</p>
<p>switch</p>
<p>so we don't have to inject our software in</p>
<p>in benign.</p>
<p>So to me, because you're at the control</p>
<p>plane and you're not dealing,</p>
<p>so you're basically telling dynamically</p>
<p>the network</p>
<p>what to do based off of the identities</p>
<p>that you find on the network.</p>
<p>When people have registered on this device</p>
<p>or on this application,</p>
<p>running on this device, and I can specify</p>
<p>who else I can talk</p>
<p>to, all based off of attributes of that.</p>
<p>That's absolutely correct.</p>
<p>And before we talk about the identity</p>
<p>piece of this, I had one more thing</p>
<p>I wanted to talk about when it comes</p>
<p>to simplifying and obfuscating complexity</p>
<p>for the end user, because our number one</p>
<p>goal is rapid time to value.</p>
<p>So it's not just about the deployment</p>
<p>of a solution.</p>
<p>Yeah, we've made it so simple</p>
<p>that you can deploy this</p>
<p>and get it running</p>
<p>within a week to two weeks.</p>
<p>But it's the ongoing management</p>
<p>and operations of this platform</p>
<p>that you also need to be concerned about.</p>
<p>So by abstracting</p>
<p>and obfuscating the complexity day.</p>
<p>To day, to.</p>
<p>By obfuscating abstraction,</p>
<p>the complexity and keeping it intuitive</p>
<p>from the perspective of the end user</p>
<p>and making this distribution of policy</p>
<p>completely automated</p>
<p>across the entire network,</p>
<p>there's little friction here long term.</p>
<p>It's super</p>
<p>simple to manage long term as well.</p>
<p>Yeah, that to tack on to that.</p>
<p>If I'm if I'm a plan operator, if I'm a</p>
<p>if I'm an X operator, I'm doing something</p>
<p>and I'm maybe</p>
<p>I have a little bit of network background</p>
<p>as I need it to be useful,</p>
<p>but I'm not a I'm not an IEEE.</p>
<p>I might not have been in</p>
<p>a, you know, from that perspective, we,</p>
<p>we've built the solution</p>
<p>so that you can look at our policy</p>
<p>engine and say,</p>
<p>hey, this needs to talk to that.</p>
<p>And you can interpret and</p>
<p>completely understand what's happening.</p>
<p>You don't need to know what VLANs are.</p>
<p>I could flip your original question</p>
<p>and say, what aren't we?</p>
<p>Yeah, not a switch management</p>
<p>tool in the sense</p>
<p>of we're not trying to deploy VLANs</p>
<p>or we're not trying to deploy Verve's and</p>
<p>and port configuration because nothing</p>
<p>we do has anything to do with any of that.</p>
<p>We don't care</p>
<p>what port you're coming in or leaving,</p>
<p>we don't care what VLAN you're on or what</p>
<p>version or what the routing looks like.</p>
<p>It's completely abstracted away from us</p>
<p>and the abstracted words a dangerous word</p>
<p>a lot of the time.</p>
<p>But with our solution it's</p>
<p>completely indifferent.</p>
<p>You could have one good example.</p>
<p>You could put everybody in a slash</p>
<p>and we're going to work perfectly fine</p>
<p>enough to put everybody into their own</p>
<p>individual VLAN and everybody gets a verve</p>
<p>and you have a really big BGP config.</p>
<p>There</p>
<p>and that would work perfectly fine as well</p>
<p>because of how we we work with the control</p>
<p>plane topology independent.</p>
<p>Yeah. So energy independent.</p>
<p>Topology.</p>
<p>Yeah. That's pretty impressive key.</p>
<p>Because now it makes us</p>
<p>a universal solution for any industry,</p>
<p>any customer without any friction.</p>
<p>They don't have to go in and redesign</p>
<p>their network, add new VLANs, IP,</p>
<p>none of that.</p>
<p>We'll just layer right on top.</p>
<p>Okay, so let's talk some practicality.</p>
<p>So my so my listeners can understand</p>
<p>because we're going to get</p>
<p>really geeky here.</p>
<p>We already started getting geeky</p>
<p>slash AIDS like,</p>
<p>come on, damn, I know you're a CNE.</p>
<p>I could tell you're a network engineer,</p>
<p>a certified network.</p>
<p>You know, I know what that means.</p>
<p>Only because I had beat over my head</p>
<p>by one of our internal network engineers.</p>
<p>But practically speaking,</p>
<p>what you guys are saying is, I can say</p>
<p>I've got a certain device by identity</p>
<p>and I can pin it to only talk to or.</p>
<p>Users or applications.</p>
<p>And you can do that device.</p>
<p>It's usually for applications</p>
<p>or applications.</p>
<p>I look at this as like,</p>
<p>yeah,</p>
<p>I users to it's just like trifecta, right?</p>
<p>So users devices, applications</p>
<p>and then within that triangle</p>
<p>you have all these lines of things</p>
<p>talking to each other there.</p>
<p>We could secure every single channel</p>
<p>between user</p>
<p>device and application with granularity</p>
<p>within that triangle.</p>
<p>That's the visualization.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>So effectively what you could do and</p>
<p>you're doing this at the network control.</p>
<p>Layer at the edge. Right.</p>
<p>So that traffic won't even</p>
<p>it won't even the edge.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>Those networks at the moment,</p>
<p>the traffic hits that first edge, switch</p>
<p>that ingress point.</p>
<p>It's being secure.</p>
<p>It doesn't have to go anywhere else.</p>
<p>It's the most efficient way</p>
<p>to apply security right at the edge.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>You know, it it really sounds to me</p>
<p>a lot like the original</p>
<p>controls they put in Unix</p>
<p>when Unix was running on just one machine.</p>
<p>Right where I've got identity,</p>
<p>I'm only allowed access</p>
<p>to certain programs, certain data</p>
<p>and certain directories, right?</p>
<p>And a lot of times maybe even certain</p>
<p>amount of processing power.</p>
<p>I had quotas and and all.</p>
<p>But you guys have done this</p>
<p>at the network,</p>
<p>which says that when I come in</p>
<p>my identity, I come in as Darren.</p>
<p>You guys can really pin me to</p>
<p>Darren gets to run three applications</p>
<p>on these three machines and that's it.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Darren you know why</p>
<p>we have to do it at the network layer</p>
<p>and not at the application</p>
<p>layer is because not all of these.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>First of all, we have users</p>
<p>that might be on Macs and laptops</p>
<p>and things like that</p>
<p>that you can put a user agent.</p>
<p>But what about all the tens of thousands</p>
<p>or hundreds of thousands of devices</p>
<p>in your network that you can't put</p>
<p>an agent on, that you can't modify?</p>
<p>They have embedded operating systems,</p>
<p>cameras, badge readers, people.</p>
<p>Oh, especially on the outside.</p>
<p>You can't happen at the device itself.</p>
<p>It's got to be.</p>
<p>Yeah, right</p>
<p>where it comes into the network.</p>
<p>I love your guys's approach</p>
<p>because what you did</p>
<p>was you destroyed, what,</p>
<p>four layers of the network, right?</p>
<p>Interesting. Yeah. Yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, you did. You did.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>You you said I what you're saying is</p>
<p>they're still important,</p>
<p>but I'm going to secure it.</p>
<p>Not at the top of the stack. Yeah.</p>
<p>The bigger down low</p>
<p>and. Yeah.</p>
<p>And you guys, you're doing it at level</p>
<p>two right.</p>
<p>There's still a use and</p>
<p>there's still a requirement for firewalls</p>
<p>at the layer</p>
<p>three boundary</p>
<p>or at the edge of the network.</p>
<p>That's that's always going to be there.</p>
<p>But yeah, of course, a more efficient way</p>
<p>to do it at the edge of the network</p>
<p>for that lateral East-West within VLANs,</p>
<p>across pipelines or cross border ups.</p>
<p>And we can also do the</p>
<p>the North-South piece of it.</p>
<p>But yeah, it's we have really made</p>
<p>some these legacy mechanisms</p>
<p>to be really deprecated</p>
<p>at this point.</p>
<p>And let's dig into OTTI.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>Because I want to because this is this</p>
<p>is a big, huge thing I'm dealing with.</p>
<p>Right now with a lot of my customers.</p>
<p>I am very worried about security</p>
<p>because of security has an impact</p>
<p>on functional safety</p>
<p>and and safety is the real world.</p>
<p>So I know, Dan, this is a sweet spot</p>
<p>for you, too, so help me understand</p>
<p>how I can leverage your guys's approach</p>
<p>and your guys's solution stack in in O.T.</p>
<p>Network, because</p>
<p>there's a lot of caution.</p>
<p>Ah, caution around O.T.</p>
<p>So how does this help me even more in the.</p>
<p>Yeah, so the 10/2, the classic thing</p>
<p>you hear kind of almost every time</p>
<p>people talk about it versus O.T.</p>
<p>is the, the fundamental difference</p>
<p>of what we're trying to accomplish.</p>
<p>If I'm thinking it, I'm thinking security,</p>
<p>I'm thinking integrity, confidentiality.</p>
<p>I'm thinking I want to protect what I have</p>
<p>availabilities there, too.</p>
<p>And we've kind of solved</p>
<p>that in different ways.</p>
<p>But the focused.</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>We just spin up a new instance if if we're</p>
<p>intruded on, we can spin up a new.</p>
<p>Very easy to rinse and replace.</p>
<p>It's very easy to just blow things away.</p>
<p>Like it's not a big deal without the</p>
<p>the equations flipped where</p>
<p>the the cornerstone of your safety.</p>
<p>Now we need availability,</p>
<p>we need integrity.</p>
<p>We need our</p>
<p>our things to continue to function.</p>
<p>But it's c it's safety</p>
<p>not just for people,</p>
<p>but safety for the process</p>
<p>because the process could represent</p>
<p>critical infrastructure.</p>
<p>And so it's</p>
<p>a completely different mindset.</p>
<p>So and a good comparison is something in</p>
<p>it might exist for six months or a year,</p>
<p>something in OT might exist for 20 years</p>
<p>in the sense of a process that you have.</p>
<p>But I have run into that where I have a</p>
<p>I have a 50 year</p>
<p>old controller controlling.</p>
<p>I don't I don't doubt it. And.</p>
<p>And they're not going to replace it.</p>
<p>And they're probably doing</p>
<p>kind of a fail till maintenance</p>
<p>thinking in the sense of that,</p>
<p>then that's a very common</p>
<p>thing in the sense of,</p>
<p>hey, I'm just going to</p>
<p>and that's a very valid design</p>
<p>where you've got people like,</p>
<p>Hey, every ten years</p>
<p>I'll maintain it or something like that,</p>
<p>or I'll patch it every couple of years,</p>
<p>and then you've got other ones that go</p>
<p>even to the extreme.</p>
<p>I will not touch that environment</p>
<p>until something bad happens.</p>
<p>So it's just it's it's completely off,</p>
<p>you know, hands off</p>
<p>until some type of failure event.</p>
<p>And that's on purpose</p>
<p>often enough as opposed to not.</p>
<p>And so the intention</p>
<p>there is just totally different</p>
<p>and now comes they're looking for</p>
<p>and so on the outside</p>
<p>the idea would be essentially</p>
<p>to make sure that that safety,</p>
<p>which equates to restricting</p>
<p>connectivity, restricting</p>
<p>what who can touch what through users</p>
<p>we talked to a second ago</p>
<p>and something as simple</p>
<p>as to bring back the VLAN example.</p>
<p>Just because you're in the VLAN</p>
<p>doesn't mean an hour to you and</p>
<p>you know,</p>
<p>another hour to you or a sensor or</p>
<p>some HMD or a DCS</p>
<p>that might be one switch over.</p>
<p>Doesn't mean</p>
<p>they have to talk to each other.</p>
<p>They should.</p>
<p>There may be no valid business case</p>
<p>for them to be talking.</p>
<p>And the crux of the legacy design is that,</p>
<p>well, I put them on the same VLAN.</p>
<p>There's no way for me to stop that</p>
<p>unless I go really far into the toolbox</p>
<p>and start doing vehicles or some goofy</p>
<p>stuff like that, which is just.</p>
<p>Exotic. Then it. Becomes.</p>
<p>Greater demand to manage who the heck</p>
<p>understands how it's configured.</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>So, so with this,</p>
<p>we talked a little bit about also</p>
<p>my, my concern is identity.</p>
<p>You showed me that</p>
<p>I can actually group things together or</p>
<p>put attributes on assets</p>
<p>and set up policies based off of</p>
<p>those attributes as well or those groups.</p>
<p>So what that means, instead of saying,</p>
<p>I have to go through every single device</p>
<p>and say these devices can talk to this</p>
<p>controller, this segregation switch,</p>
<p>whatever the case may be,</p>
<p>or aggregation data point,</p>
<p>I can say, hey,</p>
<p>all these devices are sensors.</p>
<p>They can all talk to this aggregation data</p>
<p>that aggregating all data sensor,</p>
<p>but no one else can talk to it.</p>
<p>So instead of having to go</p>
<p>item by item and say, I, this can talk</p>
<p>to only this, I can group things together</p>
<p>and how possibly.</p>
<p>We think people are going to do that</p>
<p>more often than not, in the sense</p>
<p>the idea of us walking into a refinery</p>
<p>or manufacturing</p>
<p>or into some type of transit authority</p>
<p>or something like that, and say, hey,</p>
<p>let's go down to the bone</p>
<p>and let's make everything very exact.</p>
<p>That's just that's not real world.</p>
<p>And so we've designed our solution</p>
<p>to be incredibly crawler, right?</p>
<p>Meaning that, hey,</p>
<p>I just want to group all my processes</p>
<p>and they can only communicate north south,</p>
<p>no more east East-West,</p>
<p>something as simple as that</p>
<p>or hey, my line managers, they can it,</p>
<p>they can communicate to the,</p>
<p>the six or seven types of things</p>
<p>that they should huge broad brush here</p>
<p>and then my actual operators who actually</p>
<p>you know SSA or terminal into devices</p>
<p>and actually modify places live</p>
<p>well they can hit the places</p>
<p>they can at the to use</p>
<p>but nobody else gets something as simple</p>
<p>as that where you might have two</p>
<p>or three policies for an entire plan</p>
<p>but you just took your attack surface</p>
<p>from 65,000 potential attack,</p>
<p>you know, your ports, for example,</p>
<p>down to two or three.</p>
<p>Yeah. And so huge, huge, huge.</p>
<p>Vastly quickly.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So so this</p>
<p>this really turns the network on its ear</p>
<p>because right now what people do</p>
<p>is they air filter density networks as.</p>
<p>They go down. Yep.</p>
<p>Yep, as they go down and then they say</p>
<p>that's how on protecting it.</p>
<p>So they don't even use</p>
<p>VLANs. Yes, they use lands</p>
<p>and they say,</p>
<p>you know,</p>
<p>no traffic can leave this little thing.</p>
<p>But with this stuff you can control the</p>
<p>the East-West traffic and the North-South</p>
<p>independent of each other</p>
<p>and be very explicit</p>
<p>and not worry about the topology</p>
<p>of the network itself,</p>
<p>which I think is is valuable</p>
<p>because how many times</p>
<p>I've even seen this on</p>
<p>on naval ships</p>
<p>where a, a captain needs some information</p>
<p>from one network</p>
<p>to the other that are air gapped</p>
<p>and guess what happens?</p>
<p>They put a jumper cable</p>
<p>between the two switches.</p>
<p>They're going to secure and get the go.</p>
<p>That's a user trust security officer.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>And then and then the one sailor sailor</p>
<p>that did that,</p>
<p>you know, get sick or,</p>
<p>you know, something happens where he's</p>
<p>and no one knows that it's happened and</p>
<p>now you're running on secure with this.</p>
<p>I have visibility. I have control.</p>
<p>And I love the rapid time to value</p>
<p>and intuitive effective control.</p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>We think so as well.</p>
<p>What you guys just just described</p>
<p>was the whole concept</p>
<p>behind identity based security.</p>
<p>And so what that means to us</p>
<p>endlessly is about leveraging dynamically</p>
<p>learned and updated attributes</p>
<p>of all the assets in in your network</p>
<p>and using that as policy match criteria,</p>
<p>using those attributes</p>
<p>that we dynamically learn and inventory</p>
<p>as part of your policy match criteria.</p>
<p>So as you as Dan said, you can make super</p>
<p>granular policies saying</p>
<p>I want all Siemens places to do this</p>
<p>or that or have access to this or that.</p>
<p>And I want all of these other types</p>
<p>of humidity sensors to do something else</p>
<p>and have access to something else</p>
<p>based off of the model name</p>
<p>that the vendor,</p>
<p>the device behavior or whatever</p>
<p>it might be, but not based off</p>
<p>these rigid constructs like IP addresses</p>
<p>and VLANs that don't tell us anything</p>
<p>and are only valid for an assigned</p>
<p>and for a point of time right?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It just means that this policy</p>
<p>can dynamically</p>
<p>update and change</p>
<p>if the asset has also changed.</p>
<p>So it allows us to bring continuous</p>
<p>verification in this environment as well.</p>
<p>I see another great use case for this.</p>
<p>This happens a lot in hot networks.</p>
<p>I have a vendor that has to do an update</p>
<p>on my on my device.</p>
<p>So what do I do?</p>
<p>I let them in to my network</p>
<p>for a short period of time.</p>
<p>And guess what?</p>
<p>They have access to my whole network.</p>
<p>Yeah. Once you're in, you're in.</p>
<p>It's you're in, you're with this.</p>
<p>I can say I'm giving it to you</p>
<p>for 12 hours.</p>
<p>Exactly. Access to this device.</p>
<p>And that's it.</p>
<p>That's all you get.</p>
<p>Access to it even further.</p>
<p>I'm giving you short for 12 hours.</p>
<p>Here's the port combination</p>
<p>you can communicate on.</p>
<p>Here's the passage you're allowed to touch</p>
<p>and at the end of the 12 hours,</p>
<p>that's the contractor example.</p>
<p>It's just there's</p>
<p>so many numerous examples there.</p>
<p>But to put it simply, isn't it?</p>
<p>They walk in to the door and they have to,</p>
<p>you know, depending on</p>
<p>where you throw them, it's you have to</p>
<p>you have to throw them close to the bottom</p>
<p>because that's</p>
<p>where their their stuff is sitting.</p>
<p>They could have access to,</p>
<p>you know, a thousand things</p>
<p>when they might only need access to two.</p>
<p>And so it's just a different game</p>
<p>when you can restrict them</p>
<p>to those two things</p>
<p>and to three ports and say, you know,</p>
<p>here's the here's the two touch points.</p>
<p>You can have and nothing more.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>So if my listeners want to find out more,</p>
<p>they just go to listen Ecom.</p>
<p>Is that where they start</p>
<p>to reach out to you guys?</p>
<p>How do we get them in?</p>
<p>You know, information? Yeah.</p>
<p>We have a ton of resources on our website</p>
<p>and let's see dot com.</p>
<p>And if you look at the top as a resource</p>
<p>is what are videos and white papers</p>
<p>and I'm on on the technical marketing side</p>
<p>so you can go and read all my documents</p>
<p>and really understand how the</p>
<p>solution works and how it would be applied</p>
<p>in your network.</p>
<p>And you'll see how quickly</p>
<p>you could get this up and running</p>
<p>and seeing that value within a week</p>
<p>now. And it's pretty cool.</p>
<p>And Dan, I know we're going to have</p>
<p>more conversation about the hot side.</p>
<p>I'm until I'm working on something</p>
<p>right now</p>
<p>called hardened team managed security,</p>
<p>of which I've already put you guys</p>
<p>in the architecture</p>
<p>for my identity</p>
<p>based security at the network side.</p>
<p>So I love your guys approach.</p>
<p>I think it's pretty clever and simple</p>
<p>which, which to me those are</p>
<p>those are the best. Absolutely.</p>
<p>That way.</p>
