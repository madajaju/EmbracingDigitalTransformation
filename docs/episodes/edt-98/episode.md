<p>ï»¿1</p>
<p>Hello, this</p>
<p>is Darren Pulsipher, chief solution</p>
<p>architect of public sector at Intel.</p>
<p>And welcome to Embracing</p>
<p>Digital Transformation,</p>
<p>where we investigate effective change,</p>
<p>leveraging people, process</p>
<p>and technology.</p>
<p>On today's episode,</p>
<p>the emergence of the Global Data Network</p>
<p>with co-founder and CEO of MacroMeta,</p>
<p>Chetan</p>
<p>Venkatesh.</p>
<p>Chetan welcome to the show.</p>
<p>Thank you very much, Darren.</p>
<p>It's a pleasure to be here.</p>
<p>I appreciate the opportunity.</p>
<p>So, Chetan, you are the CEO</p>
<p>and co-founder of MacroMeta.</p>
<p>Why did you do this?</p>
<p>Well, you know, some people think I'm</p>
<p>just a sucker for punishment</p>
<p>because this is my fourth startup, Darren.</p>
<p>And, you know, I like to truly</p>
<p>have been solving</p>
<p>the same problem for 20 years now.</p>
<p>But, you know, it's what I call the spiral</p>
<p>staircase where you're sort of going up.</p>
<p>So you sort of see the same things,</p>
<p>but you see them from different elevations</p>
<p>and that gives you</p>
<p>a different perspective.</p>
<p>So just my background.</p>
<p>I'm an engineer turned,</p>
<p>you know, operations and startup guy</p>
<p>primarily because I</p>
<p>was not a great engineer,</p>
<p>I was an okay engineer,</p>
<p>and there were people</p>
<p>who are way better than me.</p>
<p>And when I started to work with customers,</p>
<p>I realized, Hey, this is something I can</p>
<p>do, which is take all this complex</p>
<p>technical stuff</p>
<p>and translate it into the world of the</p>
<p>customer in a way that makes sense to them</p>
<p>because they don't care</p>
<p>about all this technical things.</p>
<p>They just want to solve a problem.</p>
<p>And so, yeah, I luckily for me,</p>
<p>there's a place in the world.</p>
<p>So I was able to sort of</p>
<p>take those complex technical ideas and,</p>
<p>and turn that into business value.</p>
<p>And I've been working in data bases</p>
<p>and data</p>
<p>infrastructure for 22 years,</p>
<p>three startups prior to this,</p>
<p>most of them dealing with distributed data</p>
<p>and trying to reduce latency.</p>
<p>So I've been trying to help the world</p>
<p>save milliseconds for 20 years now.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So I might have given you, you know,</p>
<p>a few seconds back in your life, Darren.</p>
<p>Well, there you go.</p>
<p>Thank you very much for this.</p>
<p>I want to know what you did with those.</p>
<p>I completely wasted on downloading</p>
<p>cat videos on YouTube.</p>
<p>That's what I did.</p>
<p>Well, my my mission is accomplished.</p>
<p>Well, I'm glad that you're up leveling,</p>
<p>because you and I are very similar</p>
<p>this way.</p>
<p>I'm an okay engineer.</p>
<p>Software engineer,</p>
<p>but where my superpowers like yours.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>I can take really complex ideas and</p>
<p>make it easier for people to understand.</p>
<p>So we'll see how good both of us do today.</p>
<p>Making the complex world</p>
<p>of data management,</p>
<p>especially now that data is no longer</p>
<p>in your data center.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>It's it's in the cloud. It's on the edge.</p>
<p>It's on people's laptops.</p>
<p>It's on mobile</p>
<p>device. It's everywhere now.</p>
<p>And how do you effectively manage</p>
<p>all of that?</p>
<p>That's that's going to be tough.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>You know, we live, I think, in</p>
<p>sort of the wild west of data now.</p>
<p>You know, Marc</p>
<p>Andreessen said something like</p>
<p>Software is eating the world or something</p>
<p>and that about ten, 12 years back.</p>
<p>And I think software is sort</p>
<p>of eating everything at this point.</p>
<p>And largely turned,</p>
<p>you know, all kinds of constraints</p>
<p>and barriers into opportunities.</p>
<p>And one of the barriers</p>
<p>that's come down with cloud</p>
<p>now is just multi reason computing.</p>
<p>You can</p>
<p>you can basically build applications</p>
<p>that run in different parts of the world</p>
<p>at the same time. How crazy is that?</p>
<p>And it's pretty crazy</p>
<p>when you think about it.</p>
<p>You Yeah.</p>
<p>And more importantly,</p>
<p>I think what's exciting is that</p>
<p>there is this developer movement</p>
<p>that's happening in parallel</p>
<p>to make everything</p>
<p>simple, as simple as it needs to be</p>
<p>for you to be able to use them.</p>
<p>The average</p>
<p>person, you know, with some</p>
<p>computer science background</p>
<p>can build these types of things.</p>
<p>So it's really interesting</p>
<p>because we've got on one side</p>
<p>this very sophisticated technology</p>
<p>evolution and the other side</p>
<p>a simplicity movement</p>
<p>coming from developers</p>
<p>to make everything simple and easy to use.</p>
<p>And you're seeing fabulous, amazing</p>
<p>constructs like Jam Stack, for example,</p>
<p>that allow this sort of distributed</p>
<p>computing to happen at scale</p>
<p>with a great deal of simplicity</p>
<p>and super exciting stuff.</p>
<p>But, you know,</p>
<p>there's still so much of open</p>
<p>space and vast</p>
<p>frontier yet to be discovered and cleaned.</p>
<p>And I think that's sort of the big land</p>
<p>rush opportunity at the edge.</p>
<p>Distributed data management in edge</p>
<p>are just two sides of the same coin.</p>
<p>They're almost synonyms in many ways.</p>
<p>So yeah, what I found on</p>
<p>this is really interesting</p>
<p>because you talked</p>
<p>about the software developers</p>
<p>and that whole community</p>
<p>that's been built around</p>
<p>serverless function as a service.</p>
<p>Like jam stacks and things like that.</p>
<p>They all ignore data.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>There's this obsession.</p>
<p>That data</p>
<p>is ubiquitously available everywhere.</p>
<p>And what I have learned by working</p>
<p>a lot on the edge is</p>
<p>I have a lot of edge</p>
<p>now that isn't connected all the time.</p>
<p>I can't guarantee that my application</p>
<p>has access to all the data all the time.</p>
<p>So this is a bit this is a big problem.</p>
<p>It is a huge problem.</p>
<p>And, you know, a part of it is that we've</p>
<p>been spoiled by centralized computing.</p>
<p>You know, think about it all.</p>
<p>Your network was centralized, right?</p>
<p>Hey, you bring all your data and</p>
<p>turn it into one giant pile in one place,</p>
<p>and then you can slice and dice it</p>
<p>with consistency</p>
<p>with all these different guarantees</p>
<p>that are called acid.</p>
<p>You know, all that fun stuff, right?</p>
<p>And so we got spoiled.</p>
<p>And so one of the things</p>
<p>that came out of the cloud movement,</p>
<p>which is a pattern in the cloud, but</p>
<p>is an anti pattern when it comes to data</p>
<p>management, especially distributed data,</p>
<p>is this notion of stateless microservices.</p>
<p>You know, stateless works</p>
<p>great for decoupling data and compute.</p>
<p>But to your point,</p>
<p>when data is distributed</p>
<p>and you need to bring compute to</p>
<p>our data is not we're not shipping data</p>
<p>to our computers that statelessness</p>
<p>ends up becoming the huge barrier.</p>
<p>And so you actually need to embrace</p>
<p>a more stateful way of doing things.</p>
<p>And so you're right, you're</p>
<p>absolutely right.</p>
<p>People have not figured out</p>
<p>how to do stateful things.</p>
<p>And that's why Jam Stack and all these</p>
<p>serverless functions and all that stuff</p>
<p>treat data as sort of a second class</p>
<p>citizen, as a sort of a,</p>
<p>you know, a peripheral issue,</p>
<p>not a core issue.</p>
<p>Yeah. Which I think is hilarious, right.</p>
<p>When you think about it,</p>
<p>why do we even write code?</p>
<p>Yeah, to do something with data.</p>
<p>To do something with data.</p>
<p>Well, I guess if you're a gamer</p>
<p>and now you're still doing something</p>
<p>with data, but you.</p>
<p>Know, I mean, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>I mean.</p>
<p>You always are.</p>
<p>And so this concept of,</p>
<p>oh, I'm just I'm stateless.</p>
<p>I don't get I,</p>
<p>I don't know where it came from except</p>
<p>except for, I guess, a very focused</p>
<p>and myopic view of the present.</p>
<p>But the future that we have today,</p>
<p>it falls apart.</p>
<p>Well, you know, I if I could take a minute</p>
<p>to talk about state versus statelessness,</p>
<p>because it's an really interesting issue</p>
<p>we don't appreciate.</p>
<p>And they'll give a little bit</p>
<p>of a historical picture here.</p>
<p>We don't appreciate statelessness</p>
<p>as really a consequence of very good</p>
<p>UNIX design philosophy.</p>
<p>Like POSIX basically cleaned up state</p>
<p>and said State has to be these</p>
<p>discrete things and it goes</p>
<p>into specific places at specific times.</p>
<p>And it created this very clean separation</p>
<p>between compute and state and allowed,</p>
<p>you know, statelessness to come as a as as</p>
<p>a, as a first order consequence of that.</p>
<p>Right or state fulness.</p>
<p>You know, if you it complicates</p>
<p>the state complicates everything.</p>
<p>It makes everything expensive. Oh,</p>
<p>yeah, yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>And it forces people</p>
<p>to start thinking in data structures</p>
<p>that are not easy to reason with.</p>
<p>And that's the hardest problem</p>
<p>about state.</p>
<p>You know, when you're stateless, your data</p>
<p>structures are super simple, right?</p>
<p>And you have a very specific way places</p>
<p>at which you commit your data</p>
<p>and then you move on</p>
<p>and you stateless again. Right?</p>
<p>So you kind of,</p>
<p>you know, build up a little bit of state</p>
<p>and then you write it</p>
<p>and then you move on.</p>
<p>So at any point you lose something.</p>
<p>It's that little bit of intermediary state</p>
<p>that you build up, right?</p>
<p>Versus in stateful,</p>
<p>you need infrastructures</p>
<p>that are far more powerful,</p>
<p>that are even structurally more complex</p>
<p>because they're supporting the application</p>
<p>as it continually emits state.</p>
<p>And we're moving into a real time</p>
<p>streaming</p>
<p>data world and that's continually</p>
<p>emitting state from somewhere.</p>
<p>And so the infrastructures</p>
<p>are just not designed for that.</p>
<p>And that's where my company Macromedia</p>
<p>comes in, because we really built</p>
<p>a new platform for this sort of</p>
<p>continuous, real time active state</p>
<p>that is happening at the Zara better,</p>
<p>you know, whatever gajillion</p>
<p>byte scale scheduling invites.</p>
<p>Yeah, exactly.</p>
<p>You know, this is interesting</p>
<p>because I've been doing a lot of research</p>
<p>in O.T infrastructure</p>
<p>and the difference between opportunity</p>
<p>ot how state owned</p>
<p>all Iot devices have state right.</p>
<p>And I think this is fascinating</p>
<p>that you brought up that</p>
<p>you know the IT world</p>
<p>we kind of separated the two.</p>
<p>Maybe why that might be</p>
<p>why there's so much contention</p>
<p>between the opportunity professionals</p>
<p>and industries as a whole,</p>
<p>because on the IT side,</p>
<p>we've kind of ignored state.</p>
<p>But I like how you said now</p>
<p>we've got streaming data that has active</p>
<p>dynamic state.</p>
<p>I mean that's</p>
<p>that's a major shift for a lot of I.T.</p>
<p>software developers.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>You know,</p>
<p>I mean, again, I take an evolutionary</p>
<p>perspective.</p>
<p>Almost everything we've done with data</p>
<p>is historical in nature.</p>
<p>We're great at looking at the rearview</p>
<p>mirror and saying, ha, you know, that</p>
<p>I passed that thing already or a past</p>
<p>this last quarter or last season.</p>
<p>But we're terrible</p>
<p>at looking at the windscreen</p>
<p>and seeing what's coming our way.</p>
<p>Our systems don't support that,</p>
<p>which is counterintuitive.</p>
<p>You'd think that, you know,</p>
<p>just given the human,</p>
<p>you know, neural bias, right, towards</p>
<p>predicting the future,</p>
<p>we would have been overly invested</p>
<p>in technologies that allow you to process</p>
<p>data in real time.</p>
<p>But no, we've actually built</p>
<p>a great competence and process and data</p>
<p>that's historical.</p>
<p>And that's actually what what's</p>
<p>what's really, in my opinion,</p>
<p>the shift that's happening this decade.</p>
<p>A lot of what we did</p>
<p>since the first cloud infrastructures came</p>
<p>and then the big data</p>
<p>platforms came and then,</p>
<p>you know, data as a service started in</p>
<p>March was just get very efficient</p>
<p>at ingesting and processing</p>
<p>and analyzing historical data.</p>
<p>But now we're starting to get into a world</p>
<p>where data needs to be,</p>
<p>you know, kind of</p>
<p>you need to think of data as on a spectrum</p>
<p>rather than as these, you know, just one</p>
<p>monolithic, monolithic thing, because data</p>
<p>has maybe five or six qualities</p>
<p>that are now starting to get appreciate.</p>
<p>The first one is data has perishable</p>
<p>insight, value data has shelf life.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>I when you first brought this up,</p>
<p>I thought this is hilarious</p>
<p>because the first thing that came to</p>
<p>my mind is bananas, right?</p>
<p>Because bananas it I lived in Brazil</p>
<p>for two years</p>
<p>and I know what real ripe bananas are.</p>
<p>We don't have those in the U.S.</p>
<p>unless they're like, totally brown. Yeah.</p>
<p>But to have a very ripe banana,</p>
<p>you watch it go through its progress</p>
<p>and then it spoils.</p>
<p>So you're saying the same sort of thing</p>
<p>with data.</p>
<p>It has really important value,</p>
<p>but as time goes</p>
<p>on, that value can spoil over time.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>They have their shelf life and data.</p>
<p>And I think of then, you know,</p>
<p>there's different types of shelf life.</p>
<p>There's data</p>
<p>that is valid in tens of milliseconds,</p>
<p>you know, hundreds of milliseconds.</p>
<p>There's some value there.</p>
<p>And then it's sort of the half</p>
<p>life of that data</p>
<p>just sort of falls off the cliff.</p>
<p>There's not not enough valuable things.</p>
<p>And then there's other forms of data</p>
<p>that are sort of really hundreds</p>
<p>of milliseconds of seconds</p>
<p>and so on and so forth.</p>
<p>The big data systems</p>
<p>really operate at the level of,</p>
<p>you know, many seconds,</p>
<p>multiple seconds and onwards to minutes.</p>
<p>But substantially, almost everything</p>
<p>we want to do, which comes with the</p>
<p>you know, which comes</p>
<p>with trying to interact</p>
<p>between systems or people in systems.</p>
<p>You know, those timescales are too big,</p>
<p>our brains too fast for those timescales.</p>
<p>So we need systems</p>
<p>that are really within 50 milliseconds</p>
<p>for us to build,</p>
<p>you know, to be able to communicate</p>
<p>efficiently and reduce cognitive overhead</p>
<p>for those people who are interacting</p>
<p>with those systems.</p>
<p>Latency is actually it's not it's not</p>
<p>latency is a big cognitive overload</p>
<p>for most people. I mean, imagine</p>
<p>watching a choppy video on YouTube.</p>
<p>You hate it, right?</p>
<p>I mean. We go, oh, yeah, yeah,</p>
<p>I change channel.</p>
<p>You change channels, right?</p>
<p>I mean, the minute your Netflix starts</p>
<p>to buffering your screen, you know,</p>
<p>you're like,</p>
<p>what's going on? And you know, you're up.</p>
<p>So latency, most people misunderstand.</p>
<p>It's not something that gives you joy.</p>
<p>The lack of latency makes you very upset</p>
<p>and angry.</p>
<p>It's just a cognitive function</p>
<p>of our brains right now.</p>
<p>That's human latency, right?</p>
<p>Our perceptions of latency</p>
<p>are like 75 milliseconds and below</p>
<p>are 50 milliseconds, and below 50</p>
<p>milliseconds for a machine is an eternity.</p>
<p>You know, it can do a gazillion things</p>
<p>in those 50 milliseconds.</p>
<p>So latency ends up becoming sort of this</p>
<p>very key thing.</p>
<p>And so when you start to look through,</p>
<p>you know, data has shelf life</p>
<p>and perishable value</p>
<p>there, you just start to see problems</p>
<p>in a little bit</p>
<p>of a different perspective.</p>
<p>The second issue is</p>
<p>and now because of cloud and, you know,</p>
<p>interconnectivity and global system,</p>
<p>the startups are global companies.</p>
<p>Now, it's not like the old days</p>
<p>where you had to be an IBM,</p>
<p>you know, to be in 20 countries. Right.</p>
<p>I mean, my tiny little startup,</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>We operate in all these different regimes.</p>
<p>And so everyone's global</p>
<p>and their data is location sensitive.</p>
<p>Now, some of that data is probably</p>
<p>regulated.</p>
<p>You know,</p>
<p>you've got some PII, you're connecting.</p>
<p>And guess what,</p>
<p>if you're in certain jurisdictions,</p>
<p>that data can't be exfiltrated.</p>
<p>You shouldn't be sending it</p>
<p>out of the country.</p>
<p>This whole privacy shield,</p>
<p>you know, thing that happened</p>
<p>between the US and Europe</p>
<p>is a great example of that.</p>
<p>The Europeans really don't want their data</p>
<p>leaving their borders,</p>
<p>you know, and unfortunately, guess what?</p>
<p>All the cloud</p>
<p>infrastructure is mostly here</p>
<p>and we build our applications here.</p>
<p>You know, it's</p>
<p>not because we want everyone's data, it's</p>
<p>just because this is where we built</p>
<p>the data centers in the clouds.</p>
<p>Right. Right.</p>
<p>So so there are some interesting problems</p>
<p>with data center relocation, anything.</p>
<p>The third part of this is also that data</p>
<p>sets in all these kinds of places.</p>
<p>There are boundaries</p>
<p>between systems, physical boundaries.</p>
<p>There are different data centers.</p>
<p>They're different parts of the world</p>
<p>are geographically distributed</p>
<p>or there are logical boundaries,</p>
<p>which is I've got an app that needs data</p>
<p>that's in this part of the business.</p>
<p>And another part of data</p>
<p>that's in a, you know, supply chain</p>
<p>with a partner, for example.</p>
<p>So data</p>
<p>essentially is very static in origin.</p>
<p>And what we need is infrastructures</p>
<p>that allow you to connect</p>
<p>data, get it flowing in real time</p>
<p>with consistency guarantees,</p>
<p>with ordering guarantees,</p>
<p>but most importantly,</p>
<p>be able to turn that data</p>
<p>and know you know, fungibility, create</p>
<p>fungibility with the data,</p>
<p>allow it to be consumed</p>
<p>very rapidly and quickly in diverse ways</p>
<p>through putting APIs on that data.</p>
<p>So that's sort of the second thing</p>
<p>that's driving a lot of this movement</p>
<p>away, right towards distributed,</p>
<p>which is the location and the boundaries.</p>
<p>And third thing is a lot of data</p>
<p>just has a lot of noise in it.</p>
<p>There's very little signal, lots of noise,</p>
<p>and it makes no sense to backhaul</p>
<p>all of that data</p>
<p>intercontinental distances,</p>
<p>paying transfer fees to our network</p>
<p>providers only to draw most of it away.</p>
<p>You know, when we get it all there</p>
<p>because we're filtering or aggregating</p>
<p>or doing things like that.</p>
<p>So when you start to appreciate,</p>
<p>you know, these aspects of data gravity,</p>
<p>that data originates</p>
<p>in certain places and loses value</p>
<p>by the time it gets to its destination</p>
<p>that there is location, boundaries</p>
<p>and sensitivity to those things.</p>
<p>There's also high</p>
<p>refresh rate and changes in data, right?</p>
<p>I mean, a lot of systems are busy</p>
<p>change to process data.</p>
<p>You know,</p>
<p>I'll take data from this system, process</p>
<p>it and push it on to the next thing.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>And what ends up happening</p>
<p>is, you know, you start to see data</p>
<p>that is very high refresh rate.</p>
<p>And so systems are working on stale</p>
<p>versions of data.</p>
<p>They're not seeing the latest version</p>
<p>of the data</p>
<p>they've computed on something</p>
<p>that's stale.</p>
<p>It's kind of like</p>
<p>the whole Scarlett problem.</p>
<p>When we look into the sky,</p>
<p>we're seeing light from stars</p>
<p>that came up billionaires</p>
<p>back, right? A million years back.</p>
<p>Yeah, well, guess what?</p>
<p>In terms of latency,</p>
<p>your system is seeing data</p>
<p>that could, you know, metaphorically</p>
<p>speaking, is a million years old.</p>
<p>It's it's useless.</p>
<p>You know, that's because it's still</p>
<p>and so we need new infrastructures.</p>
<p>We need new ways of solving</p>
<p>these type of distributed data problems.</p>
<p>And, you know, I'm</p>
<p>I think the next ten years belongs to this</p>
<p>this area of data sciences. So.</p>
<p>So do you think this is I mean, can Im</p>
<p>I just going to fix this</p>
<p>with this infrastructure changes</p>
<p>or is this going to cause a paradigm</p>
<p>shift as in programing models as well</p>
<p>where or can I can I leverage what I've</p>
<p>what I've just spent</p>
<p>the last 20 years doing right.</p>
<p>Can I leverage that stuff in in this</p>
<p>new world where data is king or not?</p>
<p>I know you see where I'm going with that.</p>
<p>No, I think it has to be incremental.</p>
<p>Otherwise it's not going to get broad</p>
<p>scale adoption.</p>
<p>I mean, we are an incremental species</p>
<p>and civilization, right.</p>
<p>Disruptive changes,</p>
<p>as much as they're disruptive,</p>
<p>still have some sort of an on on ramp</p>
<p>on on board that you can get on the right.</p>
<p>And I think we saw that</p>
<p>with the first generation</p>
<p>of distributed data solutions,</p>
<p>a lot of folks tried to build distributed</p>
<p>data solutions</p>
<p>using some exotic technologies.</p>
<p>You know, maybe five, ten years back,</p>
<p>there was those technologies called</p>
<p>operational transformation.</p>
<p>And, you know,</p>
<p>Google Docs is a great example of that.</p>
<p>And everybody</p>
<p>thought operational transformation is</p>
<p>how we're going to solve this data problem</p>
<p>for distributed data.</p>
<p>But operational transformation</p>
<p>requires centralization of the control.</p>
<p>There.</p>
<p>And so it doesn't scale very well</p>
<p>because the more participants you have</p>
<p>that are trained to distribute data</p>
<p>and coordinate consistency</p>
<p>in ordering of data, in that centralized</p>
<p>layer becomes a chokepoint.</p>
<p>Now, in Google's case,</p>
<p>they've got extensive infrastructure,</p>
<p>very smart scientists,</p>
<p>and they've figured out a way</p>
<p>to make operational transformation work</p>
<p>at scale with things like Google Docs.</p>
<p>But that doesn't generalize</p>
<p>very well to the average developer, right.</p>
<p>In fact, if you think about distributed</p>
<p>data problems,</p>
<p>there are</p>
<p>maybe only five companies in the world</p>
<p>that really understand it at that scale.</p>
<p>Stats Amazon, Google, Facebook</p>
<p>and your and Google.</p>
<p>Right. Those are the five companies. Yeah.</p>
<p>And so most of the body of knowledge</p>
<p>about how to solve distributed data</p>
<p>at scale is locked up in those companies</p>
<p>and proprietary tech in, you</p>
<p>know, in India</p>
<p>and what we're doing at macro</p>
<p>at least is sort of working with community</p>
<p>as well as with the with with academia</p>
<p>to try and create</p>
<p>just a new body of knowledge,</p>
<p>far more efficient than some of these,</p>
<p>you know, centralized models</p>
<p>to be able to do this</p>
<p>in a fully distributive way.</p>
<p>You know, this this reminds me</p>
<p>a lot of the problem that was</p>
<p>prevalent in the late nineties</p>
<p>and early 2000</p>
<p>with high performance computing,</p>
<p>same same similar type of problem</p>
<p>when they started</p>
<p>building the first clouds,</p>
<p>which they call grids.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>With disparate systems</p>
<p>scattered all over the place,</p>
<p>they have the same sort of problem.</p>
<p>I have data that needs to be scattered</p>
<p>all over the place, but I need it</p>
<p>with low latency.</p>
<p>I need it as close to the compute</p>
<p>as it is.</p>
<p>Do we have any learnings from from that,</p>
<p>that old grid storage space?</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>I mean, Hadoop is and is the</p>
<p>is the consequence of that, right?</p>
<p>Yeah, that's. True. Yeah.</p>
<p>I think great things came out of the HPC</p>
<p>clustering grid stuff.</p>
<p>I mean, you're giving me memories</p>
<p>over here and remembering</p>
<p>Linux in the Bill</p>
<p>Wolff project from back in the early 2000.</p>
<p>That's right.</p>
<p>It was so exciting because suddenly</p>
<p>you could put things together.</p>
<p>There was another amazing I'm sorry,</p>
<p>I'm going to reminisce for a second,</p>
<p>but one of my. Oh, that's fine.</p>
<p>One of my favorite projects</p>
<p>from that time was</p>
<p>a project called Mosaics Open Mosaics from</p>
<p>I remember,</p>
<p>I think it might have been a university</p>
<p>in Israel that that did that.</p>
<p>I believe it was a moshe</p>
<p>something or the other</p>
<p>who built that amazing piece of tech.</p>
<p>And I built my first 3D rendering farm</p>
<p>using that technology as my</p>
<p>you know, people are building</p>
<p>rendering fonts today.</p>
<p>I built an IT rendering farm as a service,</p>
<p>you know, 15 years back using open mosaics</p>
<p>because you could upload</p>
<p>a raytracing file and we would farm it out</p>
<p>using open mosaics of 25 servers.</p>
<p>That's hilarious.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I wrote I wrote my senior</p>
<p>thesis on distributed raytracing.</p>
<p>Oh, wow. Yeah. So</p>
<p>are we the same person?</p>
<p>I know we might be the same person.</p>
<p>It feels, like, hilarious.</p>
<p>It feels like you're just.</p>
<p>We're versions of each other here.</p>
<p>Yeah, we are. This is.</p>
<p>This is pretty funny.</p>
<p>Yeah. Yeah.</p>
<p>All right, so so</p>
<p>let's dig into a little bit</p>
<p>on what Macromedia</p>
<p>has tackled and how,</p>
<p>you know, as a developer</p>
<p>or maybe not even as a developer, right?</p>
<p>As a systems engineer, as a solutions</p>
<p>engineer, how would I leverage something</p>
<p>like what you guys provide?</p>
<p>Is it just this,</p>
<p>hey, data is available everywhere</p>
<p>or what exactly</p>
<p>what exactly did macrame tackle for us?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So, you know, we think that</p>
<p>there's already a lot of high quality,</p>
<p>you know, infrastructure available</p>
<p>for solving</p>
<p>sort of this historical system</p>
<p>of record type of problems.</p>
<p>I mean, we've got databases</p>
<p>that are amazing.</p>
<p>Yeah, right.</p>
<p>And today,</p>
<p>you know, you can go to the cloud</p>
<p>and you can fire up a plan at scale</p>
<p>or nobody else.</p>
<p>And you can throw infinite</p>
<p>amounts of historical data at it</p>
<p>and it'll chop it up like a champion.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>And, you know, same thing with data lakes.</p>
<p>You've got snowflakes,</p>
<p>you've got you know,</p>
<p>you've got the databricks of the world,</p>
<p>all that.</p>
<p>They're great at historical stuff and</p>
<p>they're trying to move towards real time.</p>
<p>But their architectures fundamentally</p>
<p>aren't meant for these things.</p>
<p>They're rare view systems,</p>
<p>as I like to call them.</p>
<p>But these new problems with data</p>
<p>where there's time sensitive location,</p>
<p>sensitivity, actuation</p>
<p>value, refresh rates, data, gravity,</p>
<p>data, noise, they require a new way,</p>
<p>a new infrastructure.</p>
<p>And I think of these</p>
<p>as systems of interaction</p>
<p>because they're closer</p>
<p>to where data originates,</p>
<p>they're closer to where data is consumed.</p>
<p>The closer where people are.</p>
<p>And so you can solve systems</p>
<p>of interaction problems</p>
<p>with systems of record</p>
<p>because systems of record,</p>
<p>our databases in beta are houses,</p>
<p>systems are actually a dealer networks</p>
<p>because here you need to ingest data,</p>
<p>you need to filter and rich augment</p>
<p>all of that in line and you need to root</p>
<p>data to its intended recipients.</p>
<p>Systems are people.</p>
<p>It's a network, it's</p>
<p>a networking function.</p>
<p>Now, suddenly</p>
<p>you need to start data like packets</p>
<p>and you need network processors</p>
<p>that are moving data around.</p>
<p>And that's what McNamara has built,</p>
<p>which is a, you know, a</p>
<p>global data network.</p>
<p>And it's a serverless</p>
<p>API system, is a serverless platform</p>
<p>that developers simply consumer APIs</p>
<p>and we now give them these abilities</p>
<p>through those APIs to solve these,</p>
<p>you know, real time active data,</p>
<p>operational data problems that we have.</p>
<p>And, you know, just to double click one,</p>
<p>they're deep into the global data network</p>
<p>that MacRobert operates.</p>
<p>Think of it as sort of ace, you know,</p>
<p>something like Akamai, a CDP, right?</p>
<p>A topology like a CDM,</p>
<p>but a data platform like Snowflake.</p>
<p>Imagine you smash those two together in a</p>
<p>in one of those actual linear</p>
<p>accelerators, right?</p>
<p>Like the one in CERN.</p>
<p>And, you know, you got this exotic</p>
<p>new infrastructure that came out</p>
<p>from smashing these two prototypes.</p>
<p>That's what Macromedia is.</p>
<p>It's a global data network</p>
<p>in the topology of a CD,</p>
<p>unlike Akamai or Cloudflare vastly.</p>
<p>But on the other end, it's</p>
<p>actually a data platform</p>
<p>like Snowflake and MongoDB</p>
<p>that gives you very rich data primitives</p>
<p>to be able to deal with these real time</p>
<p>active data operational data</p>
<p>values.</p>
<p>So I can take my analytics set.</p>
<p>I want to do on real time</p>
<p>and the tools that I'm used to using,</p>
<p>and I can integrate them in</p>
<p>with this global data network</p>
<p>so that I can deploy these analytics</p>
<p>anywhere</p>
<p>close to where the data is generated</p>
<p>or where the data is</p>
<p>required, where the data comes in, correct</p>
<p>is that exactly.</p>
<p>So exactly.</p>
<p>Instead of</p>
<p>I'll give you a couple of direct examples</p>
<p>in the retail world, for example,</p>
<p>you know, we're all used to getting</p>
<p>next day delivery or same day</p>
<p>delivery in many cases.</p>
<p>And that's the Amazon nowadays. We are.</p>
<p>We are. Right.</p>
<p>And that's the Amazon prime effect.</p>
<p>But remember, five years, six years back</p>
<p>when we didn't have it, you know,</p>
<p>you usually take weeks,</p>
<p>two weeks to get to us,</p>
<p>but we're not going back</p>
<p>to that world anymore because Amazon</p>
<p>fundamentally changed retail distribution</p>
<p>with an edge architecture</p>
<p>instead of fulfilling everything from,</p>
<p>you know, a single fulfillment center</p>
<p>in a state or in a region,</p>
<p>they built caches of physical goods</p>
<p>close to you and me so that when we order,</p>
<p>they can basically locate</p>
<p>which is the closest place</p>
<p>and ship it from there to us. Right.</p>
<p>And then clever algorithms</p>
<p>keep telling them</p>
<p>what are the most popular things</p>
<p>to keep on different caches, basically.</p>
<p>So what we're what management has done</p>
<p>is fundamentally build the Amazon</p>
<p>Prime for data, which is we're basically</p>
<p>bringing data and computation on that data</p>
<p>much closer to where you are and allowing</p>
<p>that to happen in milliseconds.</p>
<p>So we can allow you, for example,</p>
<p>to put our network in four of your apps.</p>
<p>And, you know, in retail as an example,</p>
<p>a lot of retail customers use us</p>
<p>as a way to connect the in-store inventory</p>
<p>with their fulfillment system</p>
<p>and the e-commerce system.</p>
<p>So as an example,</p>
<p>you're shopping for hardware,</p>
<p>you're doing a new newborn project,</p>
<p>you go to your favorite,</p>
<p>you know, version of Home Depot</p>
<p>or whatever that is as you're shopping</p>
<p>and you add things to your basket,</p>
<p>those are items</p>
<p>that are actually in the closest store you</p>
<p>so you never get oversubscribed</p>
<p>because that's one of the biggest</p>
<p>frustrations.</p>
<p>For example,</p>
<p>people are doing these things out,</p>
<p>which is I bought five carts from here.</p>
<p>They ran out.</p>
<p>I got to go to the next door.</p>
<p>Where's the visibility for all of this?</p>
<p>So this ability to create real time</p>
<p>loops of data and retailers</p>
<p>is extraordinarily powerful</p>
<p>because it allows the small guys</p>
<p>who don't have Amazon's computer science</p>
<p>and cloud and all of that</p>
<p>to really be able to compete with Amazon.</p>
<p>So, you know, we're seeing a lot of that</p>
<p>sort of intersection of retailing</p>
<p>and ads</p>
<p>and real time data as a powerful enabler.</p>
<p>Another one is in cybersecurity.</p>
<p>Some of our customers are cyber</p>
<p>security enterprises that are ripping out</p>
<p>their centralized data models</p>
<p>and creating distributed data models</p>
<p>to take advantage of lower latency so</p>
<p>they can block threats in real time now.</p>
<p>Yeah, so that's a really good use case</p>
<p>because the sheer volume of data</p>
<p>that's generated from network logs</p>
<p>or system</p>
<p>logs, host logs is, is huge.</p>
<p>And today I was talking to a</p>
<p>agency in the U.S.</p>
<p>government.</p>
<p>They bring all their cyber threat logs</p>
<p>back to the U.S.</p>
<p>to do all their processing.</p>
<p>And then they'll tell you two days later,</p>
<p>if you've been there, you can't do that.</p>
<p>So with your guys's stuff,</p>
<p>I can push that analytics</p>
<p>out to the edge very easily, right?</p>
<p>I do.</p>
<p>Do I have to do you guys have like</p>
<p>orchestration where I can say, hey,</p>
<p>go run this on all these types of data</p>
<p>and it will distribute my,</p>
<p>my and my containers or analytics,</p>
<p>it'll distribute those out.</p>
<p>Or do I have to do that distribution</p>
<p>myself?</p>
<p>No, you don't have to do the distribution</p>
<p>yourself.</p>
<p>You connect us to your data sources</p>
<p>and your data destinations,</p>
<p>and we sit in the middle</p>
<p>and take care of all of this in real.</p>
<p>Time for you.</p>
<p>So it's ours.</p>
<p>So you take care</p>
<p>of all the orchestration of data.</p>
<p>I'm dropping my service, my</p>
<p>my stateless server serverless</p>
<p>container close to where the data is</p>
<p>and it can do its job.</p>
<p>If I can share three slides,</p>
<p>it might actually be helpful.</p>
<p>Is that something I could do?</p>
<p>Absolutely. Yeah.</p>
<p>Okay, great.</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>So as I was explaining, the Global Data</p>
<p>Network really addresses sort of this</p>
<p>real time needs around data</p>
<p>and data management and analytics.</p>
<p>Right? And it sort of acts as a plumbing.</p>
<p>It's a little transformation layer</p>
<p>that you put between your data sources</p>
<p>and receivers</p>
<p>with the consumers and the publishers</p>
<p>and it sort of takes care of it.</p>
<p>It's composed of three technology pieces.</p>
<p>The first is what we call the global data</p>
<p>mesh.</p>
<p>It's the integration layer for data.</p>
<p>The second is a global compute fabric</p>
<p>that allows you to orchestrate data</p>
<p>and business logic in the form</p>
<p>of functions and containers globally.</p>
<p>And then the third piece</p>
<p>is what we call the global privacy fabric,</p>
<p>which is the way to secure data</p>
<p>and comply with different data regimes</p>
<p>and regulations that might be in effect</p>
<p>wherever your data is, you know, either</p>
<p>transmitting or being stored.</p>
<p>So let's start with the global data mesh,</p>
<p>which really is a way for you</p>
<p>to integrate data from different systems</p>
<p>just very quickly and easily.</p>
<p>So you've got systems that are sitting in,</p>
<p>you know, across different boundaries,</p>
<p>maybe physical boundaries of data center</p>
<p>and region,</p>
<p>maybe they're geo distributed data.</p>
<p>Some is in Europe, some is over here.</p>
<p>Maybe it's logical.</p>
<p>You've got data</p>
<p>in one part of your business and systems</p>
<p>in one part of your business and maybe</p>
<p>other data partner systems, for example.</p>
<p>And so the data mesh acts as a way</p>
<p>for you to integrate all of this stuff</p>
<p>and get data flowing with consistency</p>
<p>and with,</p>
<p>you know, ordering guarantees,</p>
<p>which is one of the biggest</p>
<p>and hardest problems over here</p>
<p>because getting in get really, you know,</p>
<p>you can get all kinds of twisted ways,</p>
<p>right when you start getting it flowing.</p>
<p>But the biggest value of this global</p>
<p>data mesh is that it makes data</p>
<p>fungible and consumable by allowing you</p>
<p>to put APIs on data very, very quickly.</p>
<p>So, you know, you might spend months</p>
<p>trying to, you know,</p>
<p>clean your data</p>
<p>and then put an API on it over here.</p>
<p>Is that global data mesh?</p>
<p>That's usually a couple of hours of work,</p>
<p>for example.</p>
<p>Now, so once the data has been sort</p>
<p>of connected and it's flowing</p>
<p>and you put an API on top of it</p>
<p>and we can do this at vast scales.</p>
<p>I mean, today our global data network</p>
<p>already handles billions of events</p>
<p>per second globally,</p>
<p>but it's really designed</p>
<p>for trillions of events per second,</p>
<p>you know, and so this is an infrastructure</p>
<p>designed to move data</p>
<p>at vast scales at a very economical cost</p>
<p>compared to the cloud.</p>
<p>I mean, we can move data at 90%</p>
<p>less cost in one day,</p>
<p>that 90% less cost because of</p>
<p>some of the proprietary pieces over here.</p>
<p>So this is the first piece of the journey.</p>
<p>And then the second piece of the journey</p>
<p>is now bringing business logic</p>
<p>and orchestration to move your processing</p>
<p>closer to where your data is originating</p>
<p>or data is being consumed.</p>
<p>This is the anti cloud pattern</p>
<p>in the cloud.</p>
<p>We shy. Yeah.</p>
<p>We ship data and everything to the.</p>
<p>Yeah we should be delighted compute</p>
<p>which is very far away</p>
<p>sometimes intercontinental distances</p>
<p>here we flip it,</p>
<p>we ship the computer where the data is.</p>
<p>And so with Macromedia you can actually</p>
<p>point us to your microservices, right?</p>
<p>And we will surgically move</p>
<p>those microservices that benefit</p>
<p>or need to comply with data regulations,</p>
<p>for example, and keep them</p>
<p>distributed and move them into a region</p>
<p>where that where that process of work,</p>
<p>all of this is done dynamically.</p>
<p>And that's why we call it a network,</p>
<p>because it's routing a lot of these things</p>
<p>and putting them in the right places</p>
<p>for these things to execute.</p>
<p>And, you know, substantially,</p>
<p>once you've done the global,</p>
<p>you've got the data mesh to integrate</p>
<p>data, you've got the compute.</p>
<p>Now that's serving data</p>
<p>on top of that are ingesting</p>
<p>and processing data and analyzing data.</p>
<p>Now you need to start worrying about the</p>
<p>next order of problems, which is, yeah.</p>
<p>I was going to say</p>
<p>protection of data, right?</p>
<p>I, you mentioned it earlier in the podcast</p>
<p>where you've got</p>
<p>GDPR, you got California's Privacy Act,</p>
<p>so you need some kind of access control</p>
<p>over all this data as well.</p>
<p>Right, exactly.</p>
<p>And these are really hard problems.</p>
<p>And the answers we have</p>
<p>today are terrible.</p>
<p>Your answer really is going to open up</p>
<p>a separate you know, going</p>
<p>to open up a separate silo,</p>
<p>you know, an instance of your app</p>
<p>for that particular</p>
<p>geo to comply with those particular.</p>
<p>And then, you know, every time you spin</p>
<p>one of those up, you need a separate team.</p>
<p>Everybody on security surface</p>
<p>that is exploded.</p>
<p>It's just an ugly,</p>
<p>ugly way of doing things.</p>
<p>And so, you know, in McNamara's view,</p>
<p>we've this is the data network that's</p>
<p>already integrating and getting your data</p>
<p>to flow across all these boundaries.</p>
<p>Now you've got compute functions</p>
<p>also being able to serve and,</p>
<p>you know, ingest data on top of that</p>
<p>without boundaries.</p>
<p>Well, now</p>
<p>we can basically create logical boundaries</p>
<p>and we can pin Japan and Geofence data</p>
<p>to specific regions.</p>
<p>We can set affinities and policies</p>
<p>about how data lives in a region,</p>
<p>how it replicates, should it be anonymized</p>
<p>when it's replicated out of the region?</p>
<p>For example.</p>
<p>See, I, I love your guys's approach</p>
<p>because it put data as the primary user</p>
<p>instead of the secondary</p>
<p>second class citizen,</p>
<p>which it has been for the last 40 years.</p>
<p>I love this, a great approach.</p>
<p>So how do people find out more about this?</p>
<p>Yeah, about Macromedia.</p>
<p>Just go to your website</p>
<p>or how do they get in contact with you?</p>
<p>The best way to to learn</p>
<p>more about Macromedia is go to our website</p>
<p>WW Macromedia dot com</p>
<p>and you know we've got a lot</p>
<p>of educational material over here</p>
<p>and it's a brave new world</p>
<p>and it's exciting time,</p>
<p>you know, for folks who want to</p>
<p>sort of explore this new frontier with us,</p>
<p>what I can tell you is that there are</p>
<p>some use cases that are, you know,</p>
<p>extraordinarily</p>
<p>that impossible to do in the cloud.</p>
<p>I call them impossible apps</p>
<p>because the clouds are too far</p>
<p>or it's too slow</p>
<p>and it just is not a good purpose.</p>
<p>Fit for these types of problems.</p>
<p>And so for those classes of real time</p>
<p>data problems, you know, we've built</p>
<p>an infrastructure to solve them</p>
<p>because we've been thinking hard</p>
<p>about this for now seven or eight years,</p>
<p>about what the next ten years of stateful</p>
<p>data computing is in the visible world.</p>
<p>And that's what the platform</p>
<p>is really designed to do.</p>
<p>So as much as this is sort of my marketing</p>
<p>spiel over here, I like to say that,</p>
<p>you know, the next ten years are really</p>
<p>about these global data problems.</p>
<p>And, you know, customers</p>
<p>have all these emerging data problems.</p>
<p>And, you know, we're a platform</p>
<p>that can help very quickly and easily</p>
<p>turn them into opportunities</p>
<p>rather than, you know, big challenges.</p>
<p>Hey, Chetan,</p>
<p>thank you again for coming on the show.</p>
<p>This has been insightful.</p>
<p>We most definitely want you to come back.</p>
<p>I loved it because we can</p>
<p>we can reminisce.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Let's talk about the the early 2000s</p>
<p>because I think that was sort of yeah,</p>
<p>that was the Cambrian era of computer</p>
<p>science to me because all the.</p>
<p>Absolutely.</p>
<p>You know and I also maybe one last piece</p>
<p>of reminiscing before I say, but</p>
<p>I almost feel like everything we do in</p>
<p>the cloud is just basically putting</p>
<p>a more fungible interface</p>
<p>on top of mainframes.</p>
<p>Literally every data structure invented</p>
<p>the mainframe world</p>
<p>has become a service in the cloud.</p>
<p>Yep, it has. You're right. You're right.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>We've got to change that paradigm.</p>
<p>We do.</p>
<p>So. All right.</p>
