<p>Hello, this</p>
<p>is Darren Pulsipher chief solution</p>
<p>architect of public sector at Intel.</p>
<p>And welcome to Embracing</p>
<p>Digital Transformation,</p>
<p>where we investigate effective change,</p>
<p>leveraging people, process</p>
<p>and technology.</p>
<p>On today's episode, Precogs</p>
<p>Cyberattack Powers with Paul Giorgi</p>
<p>from XM Cyber.</p>
<p>Hey, Paul, welcome to the show.</p>
<p>Thanks, Darren.</p>
<p>Hey, Paul Giorgi</p>
<p>is our director of sales at XM Cyber.</p>
<p>When I first heard about XM Cyber,</p>
<p>I was like, I don't quite understand.</p>
<p>And then you guys coached me and taught me</p>
<p>and I was like, This is cool stuff.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So before we get into what you guys</p>
<p>do, tell me a little bit about yourself,</p>
<p>your background,</p>
<p>and how you ended up at XM Cyber.</p>
<p>Yeah, so I've been in security</p>
<p>since the late nineties,</p>
<p>started doing a lot of DHS</p>
<p>and DOD projects.</p>
<p>That was where I got my start.</p>
<p>There's a great place to learn</p>
<p>and have kind of an unlimited budget</p>
<p>to just do whatever.</p>
<p>I wanted to kind of secure the perimeter.</p>
<p>And I started there.</p>
<p>Ended up coming over and joining</p>
<p>a company called Fishnet Security,</p>
<p>doing sales engineering.</p>
<p>And that was back in 2005.</p>
<p>And then I fell in love</p>
<p>with sales engineering.</p>
<p>If you would have asked</p>
<p>the one who's managing the firewalls</p>
<p>that Paul</p>
<p>who was managing the firewalls back then,</p>
<p>if I'd ever get into anything</p>
<p>sales related,</p>
<p>I'd be like disgusted by the idea.</p>
<p>But I love sales engineering.</p>
<p>And so I really fell in love with it</p>
<p>at Fishnet.</p>
<p>And then my career has been kind of tied</p>
<p>within sales engineering.</p>
<p>I've worked at a few different places.</p>
<p>I participate as a co-founder</p>
<p>of a cybersecurity company</p>
<p>called Device Security.</p>
<p>I worked at exhibitions.</p>
<p>I love logs.</p>
<p>One thing I've always played around with</p>
<p>is breach and attack simulation.</p>
<p>I think that that's an emerging space.</p>
<p>The last few years that I fell in love</p>
<p>with an XM</p>
<p>Cyber Falls within that category.</p>
<p>And so when I was looking for</p>
<p>the next kind of adventure, I was like,</p>
<p>I want to do breach in attack simulation.</p>
<p>And then I surveyed</p>
<p>and I really fell in love</p>
<p>with what XM Cyber was doing</p>
<p>and their unique take.</p>
<p>And so that's that's how I ended up here.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>First of all, as you know what breach.</p>
<p>You know, simulation and attack</p>
<p>simulation,</p>
<p>you're dealing with blackout white</p>
<p>hat type of things going on here, right?</p>
<p>Yeah. Is that what it is?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>There's categories of breach in an attack</p>
<p>simulation,</p>
<p>like you can automate pen test.</p>
<p>So if you want every single day</p>
<p>to run a test in your environment,</p>
<p>that is a category</p>
<p>of reaching exact simulation.</p>
<p>And then there's what we call</p>
<p>security control validations, where</p>
<p>if you're using CrowdStrike or Sentinel</p>
<p>One or Microsoft Defender or Silence</p>
<p>or whatever the EDR tool is,</p>
<p>and you want to make sure</p>
<p>that your solution's blocking specific</p>
<p>type of variance, you can launch things</p>
<p>that look and simulate</p>
<p>those type of behaviors</p>
<p>to see, is my policy protecting me?</p>
<p>Or if it is protecting</p>
<p>me, are my playbooks working the way</p>
<p>I anticipate them?</p>
<p>So there is definite value</p>
<p>in those type of use cases.</p>
<p>We don't</p>
<p>really address either one of those kind of</p>
<p>to the extent that our competitors do.</p>
<p>We do what's called attack</p>
<p>path management.</p>
<p>And attack path management is just</p>
<p>holistically assessing your environment</p>
<p>and giving you insight into</p>
<p>how an attacker might leverage entities</p>
<p>in your environment to laterally move</p>
<p>and compromised critical assets.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So this is a this is different than what</p>
<p>we hear traditionally about cyber, right?</p>
<p>Yeah, traditionally,</p>
<p>it's detection, remediation prevention.</p>
<p>You know, those are</p>
<p>those are the typical things</p>
<p>you guys are doing, like predictive.</p>
<p>How can they get in?</p>
<p>If they do get in,</p>
<p>where can they go type of thing.</p>
<p>So you're like, oh, what's the right word?</p>
<p>It's like,</p>
<p>it's not</p>
<p>it's not like going to the doctor, it's</p>
<p>going to the gym.</p>
<p>Kind of, yeah,</p>
<p>I've sea of like a three cog sim or it's.</p>
<p>A great precogs now.</p>
<p>Now we got Minority Report going on.</p>
<p>I feel like that's been a good description</p>
<p>where it's like we're not correlating</p>
<p>a whole bunch of things</p>
<p>that are happening.</p>
<p>We're correlating a lot of stuff</p>
<p>that could have,</p>
<p>could have stringing them together,</p>
<p>a imaginative incident,</p>
<p>giving you insight into how your tools</p>
<p>might be able to address it,</p>
<p>how you could work to address remediations</p>
<p>on specific chokepoints,</p>
<p>and then if you think</p>
<p>about an organization</p>
<p>who learns a lot from a test, like back</p>
<p>when I was doing the DOD projects,</p>
<p>I was working at an Air Force base.</p>
<p>Every quarter we would have a pen test</p>
<p>and they would always get us</p>
<p>and it would just be so frustrating</p>
<p>that we'd spent so much time fixing stuff.</p>
<p>But my favorite time was</p>
<p>we would get around a conference table</p>
<p>and they would all share around, Hey,</p>
<p>we did this,</p>
<p>we did this, and then immediately</p>
<p>I would respond and address</p>
<p>all of the things</p>
<p>that they were doing to fix it.</p>
<p>And there was so much</p>
<p>we learned during those incidences.</p>
<p>So that's what we're trying to do.</p>
<p>But on a regular basis</p>
<p>and something where you can</p>
<p>fix things today,</p>
<p>see the impact of them tomorrow</p>
<p>and then continually increase</p>
<p>and improve your security.</p>
<p>So this can happen</p>
<p>well before pen testing then, right?</p>
<p>Yeah, that's the idea really.</p>
<p>There was one customer.</p>
<p>So so he says well so here's a question</p>
<p>then.</p>
<p>Yeah, right.</p>
<p>Could, could you have your red team</p>
<p>use your stuff to find their way around</p>
<p>the blue team and then go to town.</p>
<p>Right. Yeah.</p>
<p>So we actually have</p>
<p>that use case deployed.</p>
<p>And so your tool can be very dangerous.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, if you think about</p>
<p>what we're doing, I use it in.</p>
<p>The wrong hands, right? Paul</p>
<p>Yeah, exactly.</p>
<p>Like Google Maps, for example,</p>
<p>is a good analogy where it's like,</p>
<p>Hey, I want to get from one place</p>
<p>to the next place.</p>
<p>Here's my starting point, here's</p>
<p>my ending point.</p>
<p>Google Maps will tell you</p>
<p>these are all the ways to get there.</p>
<p>We do that same thing.</p>
<p>But from an attack</p>
<p>simulation, we're saying,</p>
<p>hey, if you've compromised this</p>
<p>as your Active Directory user account,</p>
<p>these are the six steps that you can take</p>
<p>in this order to be able to get to like</p>
<p>an on premise domain controller</p>
<p>and compromise that critical assets.</p>
<p>So just like Google Maps will say this is</p>
<p>the route that we recommend you take.</p>
<p>This is the one that avoids tolls.</p>
<p>This one's the most scenic route.</p>
<p>We do that same thing. We'll tell you.</p>
<p>These are the six ways</p>
<p>to get from this point to this point.</p>
<p>And you think about how</p>
<p>that would help a red teamer.</p>
<p>It makes them super efficient.</p>
<p>They don't have to waste time</p>
<p>poking around and trying to do discovery.</p>
<p>They say, this is where I'm at.</p>
<p>I want to get over here</p>
<p>except tell me how to get there.</p>
<p>And so, yeah, you're right,</p>
<p>it is kind of scary being able to to show</p>
<p>all of that data in one specific view.</p>
<p>Well, yeah,</p>
<p>you're going to enable the red team by</p>
<p>you can also give it to the blue team too.</p>
<p>So that's</p>
<p>I guess that's the next question, right?</p>
<p>You guys run all these predictive</p>
<p>attack path analysis and so what do I do?</p>
<p>You give me all that information.</p>
<p>What do I do with it?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So there's this fascinating perspective.</p>
<p>From a blue team perspective.</p>
<p>You can now prioritize your remediations.</p>
<p>If we are showing you</p>
<p>the entities that are allowing an attacker</p>
<p>to most commonly compromise</p>
<p>your critical assets,</p>
<p>you want to focus</p>
<p>your remediations on those.</p>
<p>So we call them choke points</p>
<p>and think about a choke point as a</p>
<p>if I have 400 attack paths,</p>
<p>all going to different areas in my DMZ,</p>
<p>but all 400</p>
<p>seem to have to leverage this one entity</p>
<p>to make that attack path happen.</p>
<p>I just fixed that one problem</p>
<p>on that one entity.</p>
<p>I've really destroyed 400 attack paths.</p>
<p>So from a blue teamer, it allows you</p>
<p>to prioritize your efforts at making sure</p>
<p>that you've locked down these choke points</p>
<p>that could enable an attacker.</p>
<p>We know that if an attacker is able to get</p>
<p>something like a domain admin account</p>
<p>or get onto a machine</p>
<p>like a domain controller,</p>
<p>there's a lot of stuff</p>
<p>that they can wreak havoc on.</p>
<p>They basically own the environment</p>
<p>at that point, but in most environments</p>
<p>there are accounts or entities that are</p>
<p>riskier than your domain admin accounts</p>
<p>and without having any insight,</p>
<p>you don't know what those are.</p>
<p>But I'll tell you, there's a lot of</p>
<p>like a developer account</p>
<p>who has rights from a federated identity</p>
<p>and Google and Azure.</p>
<p>And from that one account, you're able</p>
<p>to get access to all these things.</p>
<p>And that's more powerful</p>
<p>than a domain admin account.</p>
<p>Or think about an into an admin</p>
<p>or just a regular domain user</p>
<p>who has rights to use the Intune</p>
<p>admin service.</p>
<p>They could push software to any</p>
<p>as your Active Directory admin machines</p>
<p>or as your Active Directory</p>
<p>domain machines and push software.</p>
<p>So that one account is even more dangerous</p>
<p>than to make them an admin</p>
<p>because it sits above another layer but</p>
<p>then has the ability to replicate down.</p>
<p>So it's an interesting perspective</p>
<p>to now start seeing what other accounts</p>
<p>even today introduce</p>
<p>more risk than a domain admin account.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>So I got to back you up a little bit</p>
<p>because my my listeners</p>
<p>heads are spinning now.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>So I want to kind of break this down</p>
<p>a little bit.</p>
<p>You talking about attack paths, so and</p>
<p>then you were talking about user accounts.</p>
<p>So yeah, obviously in in your past stuff,</p>
<p>there's more than just user accounts.</p>
<p>There's more than just what's connected to</p>
<p>what and what firewalls are.</p>
<p>So how would you break down?</p>
<p>I mean, let's break it down a little bit.</p>
<p>Yeah, I've got identity management</p>
<p>as one of the things.</p>
<p>So that's one of the things that you guys</p>
<p>leverage is, hey, who is who in the zoo?</p>
<p>Yeah, not just in my data center,</p>
<p>but it also sounds like in the cloud.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So you guys can handle multi-cloud access</p>
<p>management</p>
<p>and or you're analyzing the access.</p>
<p>You're not doing the access management.</p>
<p>You're analyzing</p>
<p>it, correct? Yeah. Is that</p>
<p>okay?</p>
<p>So that's the identity site.</p>
<p>So if I</p>
<p>this is going to be</p>
<p>if I have multiple identities, is there</p>
<p>any way for you to track to track that?</p>
<p>I am using multiple identities or not.</p>
<p>Is that just outside of the realm?</p>
<p>So we wouldn't I mean, we don't care</p>
<p>who owns what, but if if you've ever used</p>
<p>a tool called Bloodhound, they are doing</p>
<p>the same thing that we're doing.</p>
<p>We actually have the same exact features,</p>
<p>but kind of at a much larger level</p>
<p>where if you have access</p>
<p>to a specific Active Directory user,</p>
<p>we understand that this active direct user</p>
<p>can reset the password for another one.</p>
<p>And now this past, this user account</p>
<p>has the ability to now add a GPO</p>
<p>and then from that GPO,</p>
<p>we can then do this.</p>
<p>So sometimes attack paths will be ten</p>
<p>steps long, but nine steps.</p>
<p>So I'll just be navigating the identity</p>
<p>world and it's all just due to</p>
<p>you might have permissions to your admin</p>
<p>account and then that admin account</p>
<p>might have additional permissions.</p>
<p>So if you do six or seven steps</p>
<p>adjusting groups and adjusting</p>
<p>just different permissions</p>
<p>or resetting passwords and deploying GPOs,</p>
<p>you could kind of take nine steps</p>
<p>to go from standard Darren</p>
<p>or Darren's user account</p>
<p>to then get to the point</p>
<p>where you're at domain admin</p>
<p>just by leveraging Active Directory. Wow.</p>
<p>Most people don't even know that</p>
<p>that that's an attack stuff.</p>
<p>And it gets even. More right.</p>
<p>I mean, I've got identities. Yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>I can imagine</p>
<p>because, you know, cloud identities</p>
<p>even though they try and sync them up</p>
<p>between.</p>
<p>Yeah, they're unique identities, right.</p>
<p>They're not you know, they're unique.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>So identity is one path</p>
<p>that you guys follow on attacks.</p>
<p>What's another path that you guys follow?</p>
<p>Because it just can't just be identities,</p>
<p>right?</p>
<p>You're doing but not. Yeah.</p>
<p>And so I like to use the term entities</p>
<p>because it's a generic term</p>
<p>encompassing a lot.</p>
<p>So sometimes an entity in an attack</p>
<p>path is the user like we were talking</p>
<p>about another example of a common entity,</p>
<p>it would be a machine,</p>
<p>another entity would be like an S3 bucket.</p>
<p>It's not a machine, it's not a user.</p>
<p>It's just kind of a cloud storage area.</p>
<p>Another entity is a file</p>
<p>or an associates key.</p>
<p>I mean, the list is long</p>
<p>in our supported entities.</p>
<p>I think there's about a hundred, maybe</p>
<p>even more than that, where all of these</p>
<p>different entities can all be combined</p>
<p>together to create an attack path.</p>
<p>And sometimes, like I was saying,</p>
<p>it's an attack path of ten,</p>
<p>but nine of them are just user</p>
<p>like within the user space.</p>
<p>And then sometimes it gets really complex</p>
<p>where an attack</p>
<p>starts on premise,</p>
<p>goes out to as you're takes advantage</p>
<p>of maybe Azure Intune like that</p>
<p>example we're talking about before goes</p>
<p>back over to compromise another machine</p>
<p>that then allows you to pivot over to GCP.</p>
<p>They don't want you over in the GCP</p>
<p>environment taking advantage of</p>
<p>maybe some sort of like trust</p>
<p>or permission between AWB and GCP to</p>
<p>then compromise AWB.</p>
<p>So you get really complicated</p>
<p>and you look at all</p>
<p>these different types of entities</p>
<p>and the different disparate environments,</p>
<p>and then you connect them together</p>
<p>to assess these paths around</p>
<p>how every entity holistically plays</p>
<p>together in the risk of every other.</p>
<p>Oh, so, so wow.</p>
<p>I mean,</p>
<p>most I know because I do this myself</p>
<p>sometimes I set up those paths myself</p>
<p>because obscurity is a form of security.</p>
<p>At least we thought.</p>
<p>Yeah, but it sounds like to me</p>
<p>that with tools like yours, I'm sure</p>
<p>the bad guys have tools like this too.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Now, once you get in,</p>
<p>they start looking around for paths.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So you can't use obscurity anymore, right?</p>
<p>So even if you're hopping between</p>
<p>domains or hopping between cloud service</p>
<p>providers.</p>
<p>Yeah, it sounds like you really need</p>
<p>something to help you identify these.</p>
<p>So let's say. All right,</p>
<p>how does it work as a customer?</p>
<p>I bring you guys in</p>
<p>and it's professional services</p>
<p>or I just let your software just go hog</p>
<p>wild, crazy.</p>
<p>How how does it work?</p>
<p>Explain an engagement</p>
<p>with with a customer.</p>
<p>Yeah. So there's two main ways</p>
<p>that we get engaged.</p>
<p>Sometimes it's just at a high level</p>
<p>and on a discover</p>
<p>all my attack paths</p>
<p>and that's a great, great use case.</p>
<p>Sometimes it's</p>
<p>hey, we do pen tests every quarter,</p>
<p>we get so much insight and from them</p>
<p>I would like to kind of have these done</p>
<p>on a daily basis if I could afford it.</p>
<p>But I don't have a budget of $100 million</p>
<p>to do a pen test every single day.</p>
<p>So sometimes it's just at a high level.</p>
<p>I just want to be able</p>
<p>to assess my environment.</p>
<p>And in that case, when things</p>
<p>like filling out or log for a day</p>
<p>or spring for a show</p>
<p>like those vulnerabilities of the month</p>
<p>that kind of pop up under the radar,</p>
<p>it is a really strong value</p>
<p>to for an organization</p>
<p>to measure the impact of these</p>
<p>vulnerabilities, like, hey, yesterday</p>
<p>there was only ten attack pass</p>
<p>going to this critical asset.</p>
<p>Lena dropped on the scene</p>
<p>and now I have 100.</p>
<p>And so being able to measure</p>
<p>how an attacker can operationalize</p>
<p>new vulnerabilities in your environment</p>
<p>to put your critical assets at risk,</p>
<p>that's that's</p>
<p>kind of in line with that first customer.</p>
<p>The next customer,</p>
<p>when we kind of get engaged</p>
<p>is they'll have a specific scenario.</p>
<p>There was a really large bank</p>
<p>that we did a posse with last year,</p>
<p>their customer now.</p>
<p>But when we did the posse, they said,</p>
<p>we know that our offshore developers</p>
<p>have access to one small IWC environment.</p>
<p>That's all they should have access to.</p>
<p>But we're really concerned</p>
<p>that there is some way that they have</p>
<p>the ability to abuse</p>
<p>maybe different entities</p>
<p>in the environment</p>
<p>to be able to access production data.</p>
<p>So that was a different scenario</p>
<p>where they said,</p>
<p>I want to start here</p>
<p>and see if there's any risk to that.</p>
<p>And in that case,</p>
<p>it was two days later we were saying,</p>
<p>Yeah, look at how they can abuse</p>
<p>this lambda function.</p>
<p>From this lambda function.</p>
<p>They get this role from this role</p>
<p>they can do is crawl across to me</p>
<p>and assume role capability to then</p>
<p>get access to your production data.</p>
<p>So for however long</p>
<p>that they had this configuration,</p>
<p>they had this false sense of security</p>
<p>thinking that because all their offshore</p>
<p>developers were relegated to one.</p>
<p>Yeah, they had them in a.</p>
<p>More secure, like there's no way.</p>
<p>So they came to us saying like, Hey,</p>
<p>we want to verify this.</p>
<p>And so we ran through the simulations and</p>
<p>were able to say, Hey, you're not secure.</p>
<p>And by the way, it only takes three steps</p>
<p>to get from here.</p>
<p>Over there, it's very easy.</p>
<p>So they stopped the posse, fixed</p>
<p>all of those things and then</p>
<p>resumed the PSC and is now a customer.</p>
<p>And so those are kind of the two</p>
<p>main areas where we.</p>
<p>Are targeted, right?</p>
<p>Yeah, I have a specific problem.</p>
<p>And then also tell me where I'm at.</p>
<p>This one, to me,</p>
<p>this is kind of screaming for</p>
<p>this would have to be continuously run</p>
<p>because as soon as I add another entity</p>
<p>and as three bucket a new person,</p>
<p>I could have opened up Pandora's box.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Not only just the dynamic</p>
<p>nature of cloud,</p>
<p>but we also</p>
<p>track user behavior in our simulations.</p>
<p>So in most environments</p>
<p>I've found that the security score</p>
<p>goes up during the weekend,</p>
<p>and that's because we've removed the users</p>
<p>from the environment.</p>
<p>You're moving the users, rather,</p>
<p>the score goes up.</p>
<p>I mean, every network is more secure</p>
<p>with our users.</p>
<p>So that was one thing that you find.</p>
<p>So there's a lot of patterns, not only</p>
<p>just, hey, we deployed a new application</p>
<p>or Hey, we're, we have some elasticity</p>
<p>in our cloud environment.</p>
<p>We've got like this expansion</p>
<p>that normally doesn't happen.</p>
<p>So there's a bigger attack surface</p>
<p>or like the example I gave</p>
<p>the users are doing something different</p>
<p>today.</p>
<p>What's happening today that is putting us</p>
<p>more at a security risk than yesterday.</p>
<p>So it's just not you're not</p>
<p>just doing static analysis of of entities.</p>
<p>You're also doing dynamic because you're</p>
<p>looking at traffic patterns.</p>
<p>You're looking at</p>
<p>holy cow.</p>
<p>Yeah. Yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, that's that's why. Impressive.</p>
<p>Yeah, that is a lot.</p>
<p>And you said something interesting</p>
<p>and it's</p>
<p>kind of in in jest,</p>
<p>but a serious question.</p>
<p>You basically said</p>
<p>get rid of users off your network.</p>
<p>Well, I mean, for the most secure,</p>
<p>conscious for the most and limit</p>
<p>the number of users,</p>
<p>I think that that's a really good it's</p>
<p>kind of if we talk about least privileged</p>
<p>principles, I mean, the best way</p>
<p>to get rid of privileged</p>
<p>principle or implement that is getting.</p>
<p>Rid of years. Yeah.</p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p>The reason I brought those up</p>
<p>is because the OT environment.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Which is very different than I.T</p>
<p>and I'm doing a lot of research</p>
<p>right now in OT managed security and</p>
<p>the OT guys are scared out of their minds.</p>
<p>Right, because I think rightfully so.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Because if someone hacks into your</p>
<p>critical infrastructure or people die.</p>
<p>Yeah, right.</p>
<p>This is a big deal.</p>
<p>So can you guys</p>
<p>can you guys help with that</p>
<p>pathfinding across the entity barriers</p>
<p>or do I just say</p>
<p>there are no identities in the OT network?</p>
<p>But yeah,</p>
<p>I don't know if that's an answer.</p>
<p>So go to.</p>
<p>That specific use case</p>
<p>where it's a targeted use case</p>
<p>that's a really common targeted use case.</p>
<p>We have customers</p>
<p>like in the energy sector</p>
<p>or anybody really with an O.T environment</p>
<p>that probably is having that problem</p>
<p>or problem, but it's converging.</p>
<p>Everything's kind of the same networks</p>
<p>and so there's risk to that.</p>
<p>And the old school</p>
<p>skater guys managing their PLCs,</p>
<p>he thought they were isolated because,</p>
<p>hey, this doesn't connect to our network,</p>
<p>can no longer say that anymore.</p>
<p>So now you've got this problem</p>
<p>where, hey, is oti</p>
<p>the critical asset or the breach point?</p>
<p>If you think about kind of like attack</p>
<p>passes,</p>
<p>are we getting attacked from these devices</p>
<p>or to them or.</p>
<p>Right. And so we get to calculate that.</p>
<p>But to your description,</p>
<p>we definitely have that use case</p>
<p>commonly played out like, hey,</p>
<p>is there any way from my i.t.</p>
<p>Environment, let's play</p>
<p>the scenario of somebody in h.r.</p>
<p>If somebody in h.r.</p>
<p>As machine as the breach point,</p>
<p>is there any risk to this policy</p>
<p>sitting in my skate environment</p>
<p>controlling pressure switches</p>
<p>that could turn on and off the electricity</p>
<p>for some city municipality?</p>
<p>So that is a real use case</p>
<p>that we can simulate.</p>
<p>And if we do find</p>
<p>these are the attack pass,</p>
<p>it gives you insight to remediate them</p>
<p>before an attacker finds them</p>
<p>and then takes advantage of them.</p>
<p>So so this</p>
<p>would be really important</p>
<p>to to run these simulations.</p>
<p>So that's another question I have for you.</p>
<p>I mean, is this is this a SaaS offering</p>
<p>or is it on prem?</p>
<p>I think SAS would be a little scary for me</p>
<p>personally, right?</p>
<p>Yeah, because I'm like,</p>
<p>you're going to store in the cloud</p>
<p>somewhere how people can attack me.</p>
<p>I mean, that's scary, right? Yeah.</p>
<p>So we ask the solution.</p>
<p>Early on, we did have kind of</p>
<p>we did have an on premise solution,</p>
<p>but it was really hard to keep it updated.</p>
<p>Think about. How often we're.</p>
<p>Constantly adding new attack</p>
<p>techniques and new attack vectors.</p>
<p>And so it became such a problem for us</p>
<p>to constantly be trying</p>
<p>to update all of these on prem systems</p>
<p>that we eventually said</p>
<p>for us to deliver the best service</p>
<p>that we can and constantly stay dynamic</p>
<p>with every new vulnerability and a tactic</p>
<p>that comes out, we have to be SAS only.</p>
<p>And to your point,</p>
<p>it is a little scary to think about,</p>
<p>Hey, there's something in the cloud</p>
<p>that has all of our attack techniques.</p>
<p>We do a very, very</p>
<p>we put a lot of work to make sure</p>
<p>all of our data</p>
<p>is completely isolated, SOC two compliant</p>
<p>and all these different certifications</p>
<p>showing that we don't do any multi-tenant.</p>
<p>See everything is in it's</p>
<p>isolated tenants using a WAC</p>
<p>and so we make sure everything is isolated</p>
<p>and secure and we try not to collect</p>
<p>anything sensitive.</p>
<p>Now you think about stitching their</p>
<p>their attack pass and what appears like</p>
<p>that's sensitive but if you think about</p>
<p>what we're showing you, a lot of it</p>
<p>isn't as sensitive</p>
<p>as some things like data</p>
<p>setting credit card doubles, credit card</p>
<p>numbers, PII, so, so the password.</p>
<p>So when we are doing these attacks,</p>
<p>it's really common for us to say, hey,</p>
<p>we compromised this user account,</p>
<p>we have this password sitting here,</p>
<p>but we never send anything</p>
<p>sensitive to the cloud.</p>
<p>What we do is we hash it a bunch of times</p>
<p>and we actually sent half</p>
<p>or a portion of that hash up to the cloud.</p>
<p>So that way we can say, Hey, this password</p>
<p>is the same as this password over here.</p>
<p>So we can leverage it in a way</p>
<p>where we can kind of continue to use that,</p>
<p>that password in living off the land</p>
<p>from an attack perspective.</p>
<p>But we don't have to know what it is</p>
<p>and we try to do that</p>
<p>same sort of mentality on everything</p>
<p>or it's</p>
<p>if we don't need the actual data</p>
<p>that old kind of hash it, obfuscate it,</p>
<p>and then just compare it in the cloud.</p>
<p>But we have really large references</p>
<p>for customers</p>
<p>like Nasdaq, for example,</p>
<p>is a really big customer of ours.</p>
<p>We've got Fortune 50 banks.</p>
<p>So you have to like the scrutiny</p>
<p>that we've gone over to get those times.</p>
<p>You've already gone through that.</p>
<p>So yeah, yeah, I, I bet I was a big</p>
<p>it takes a while for them right.</p>
<p>Yeah. And there's some still. Yeah.</p>
<p>So thinking or cloud is scary</p>
<p>and it's somebody else's computer</p>
<p>and I don't like that. So yeah, I get it.</p>
<p>I feel that way, the same way</p>
<p>a lot of times too.</p>
<p>So I guess here's here's</p>
<p>another quick question.</p>
<p>Have you guys moved it</p>
<p>all into the government space</p>
<p>in state and local governments</p>
<p>or federal governments</p>
<p>or, you know, national governments?</p>
<p>Have you moved into that space yet</p>
<p>or are you still getting a little pushback</p>
<p>from them?</p>
<p>You mean just with the cloud adoption?</p>
<p>Yeah. With yeah, with the cloud adoption.</p>
<p>Yeah, I think so.</p>
<p>Most of our customers are in that space.</p>
<p>Put us</p>
<p>through</p>
<p>a little bit more of a effort test.</p>
<p>Of the ringer. Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>And I mean, so, like,</p>
<p>we are owned by a German company,</p>
<p>the Schwartz Group that owns</p>
<p>XM Cyber Germany is known</p>
<p>for like a lot of really strict</p>
<p>privacy laws and things like GDPR</p>
<p>and all these different compliance.</p>
<p>So there is a kind of</p>
<p>an extra layer of scrutiny</p>
<p>just because we have to adhere</p>
<p>to these type of things like the GDPR</p>
<p>in a way that maybe we don't have to</p>
<p>as much in different areas in the States.</p>
<p>So right, it is definitely something</p>
<p>that we have to keep</p>
<p>staying in touch with and different,</p>
<p>different compliance</p>
<p>like Fedramp, for example,</p>
<p>if you're playing in federal space</p>
<p>and you want to SAS service</p>
<p>that adheres to Fedramp</p>
<p>and state fedramp compliant,</p>
<p>like there's a</p>
<p>lot of those type of things as well</p>
<p>that we continually have to work.</p>
<p>So you're so you're already in Fedramp.</p>
<p>You're in the gov cloud already. Not yet.</p>
<p>I think what we are, what do you call it</p>
<p>when it's pending authorization</p>
<p>so we don't have the certification. Right.</p>
<p>We're just going through that process.</p>
<p>You're going to.</p>
<p>Oh, that's good.</p>
<p>That's good. That's good to know. Yeah.</p>
<p>Okay, let's say that</p>
<p>I, I get all this information from you</p>
<p>guys.</p>
<p>You guys have shown me</p>
<p>where all my, my parts are.</p>
<p>Maybe I'm</p>
<p>not that sophisticated in my cyber.</p>
<p>Maybe I'm a mid-sized company. Yeah.</p>
<p>Do you guys have, like,</p>
<p>consulting services to help me figure out?</p>
<p>All right, you you found all these powers,</p>
<p>and I'm sitting there going,</p>
<p>I don't know what to do.</p>
<p>I mean, how do you educate me?</p>
<p>Or can you help me figure out what to do</p>
<p>or point me to a partner?</p>
<p>Maybe you guys have a partner</p>
<p>that does manage security.</p>
<p>I don't I don't know.</p>
<p>Yeah. What do I do?</p>
<p>So we have both every customer of ours</p>
<p>gets assigned what we call</p>
<p>customer success manager.</p>
<p>And they either have weekly</p>
<p>or biweekly meetings</p>
<p>where the whole goal of their sessions</p>
<p>together is just to take the data</p>
<p>that's coming out of our platform</p>
<p>and help them like actually use it.</p>
<p>If we're just running,</p>
<p>running these</p>
<p>theoretical is every single week,</p>
<p>but no one's fixing anything, then</p>
<p>we aren't really making anything better.</p>
<p>So what, you're not.</p>
<p>Making any progress? Exactly.</p>
<p>So what's really a fun takeaway or a fun</p>
<p>outcome of those sessions is commonly</p>
<p>those sessions will identify</p>
<p>a few things like, hey,</p>
<p>this chokepoint is impacted by this attack</p>
<p>technique.</p>
<p>It will.</p>
<p>These are the steps to remediate it.</p>
<p>Do you think we can have this done</p>
<p>by two weeks from now?</p>
<p>And then on the team, they'll assign</p>
<p>stuff, open tickets, put it in</p>
<p>for that change control window.</p>
<p>And then two weeks later, we get to now</p>
<p>see the impact and say, wow, look,</p>
<p>we had this fix.</p>
<p>Look at how it replicate</p>
<p>rippled across all the environment</p>
<p>and your security score goes up.</p>
<p>So that's kind of the main way</p>
<p>that we address</p>
<p>kind of using the solution</p>
<p>and not just turning in the shelf where.</p>
<p>But to your other point,</p>
<p>we do have a lot of partners.</p>
<p>There's a lot of like managed</p>
<p>service partners that we work with</p>
<p>who bolt on kind of these attack</p>
<p>simulation</p>
<p>offerings into their platform</p>
<p>and then allow them to have that value.</p>
<p>But the perspective it gives them</p>
<p>from a managed service, like an MDR,</p>
<p>really gives them a ton of insight</p>
<p>into the organization to help them</p>
<p>be better at offering those services.</p>
<p>Now that that that makes</p>
<p>that makes a lot of sense.</p>
<p>Yeah. Now I have another question.</p>
<p>You talked about the entities</p>
<p>and all that stuff.</p>
<p>What about if I have all of my stuff</p>
<p>encrypted?</p>
<p>Are he checking for encryption?</p>
<p>Because Intel, we've got</p>
<p>some cool technology around encryption</p>
<p>like memory</p>
<p>and use encryption right in SGX.</p>
<p>Are you guys looking down</p>
<p>at that level too?</p>
<p>So even if someone infiltrated</p>
<p>so what they can't seen.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So that's a really interesting point.</p>
<p>We just acquired a company called Cyber</p>
<p>Observer and cyber observer</p>
<p>kind of is more on the controls</p>
<p>and protection aspect of it.</p>
<p>So what we did before is</p>
<p>we kind of ignored encryption</p>
<p>or we ignored kind of security control</p>
<p>saying, Hey, this risk is still here.</p>
<p>So what they ended up being able</p>
<p>to download or access an encrypted blob.</p>
<p>They shouldn't have been able to do that</p>
<p>in the first place.</p>
<p>And there's risk to that because I</p>
<p>mean, we're talking about encryption.</p>
<p>I mean, we know that the post</p>
<p>quantum world and being able</p>
<p>to kind of be able to start</p>
<p>breaking encryption is not that far away.</p>
<p>So we don't want to have any data loss,</p>
<p>even if it is encrypted.</p>
<p>But now through this acquisition</p>
<p>of cyber observer,</p>
<p>cyber observer has API integrations</p>
<p>into different cloud</p>
<p>environments, the different security</p>
<p>controls, both cloud and on prem.</p>
<p>And now they can assess whether or not,</p>
<p>hey, that file that we simulated</p>
<p>a compromised on was</p>
<p>we had a simulation that there was</p>
<p>the acceleration that happened,</p>
<p>but cyber observer was able to say</p>
<p>it was encrypted</p>
<p>so you don't have to worry about it.</p>
<p>And then also things like</p>
<p>there was these three security controls</p>
<p>that probably would have made it harder</p>
<p>for that to happen.</p>
<p>So then we address it</p>
<p>and rate our our complexity factor.</p>
<p>So now with the insight of cyber observer,</p>
<p>we could say, hey,</p>
<p>without cyber observer, it looked like</p>
<p>this was a really easy attack.</p>
<p>But now there's this encryption to break.</p>
<p>There's this EDR solution</p>
<p>you have to bypass.</p>
<p>And so it now because cyber observer</p>
<p>told us that we're going to say</p>
<p>that this is still technically possible,</p>
<p>but it is something that's</p>
<p>going to be more complex than something</p>
<p>that doesn't have that.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>That that makes a lot of sense to me.</p>
<p>So with without this new acquisition,</p>
<p>you guys made it.</p>
<p>Can I get access?</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>Basically now it's like, Oh,</p>
<p>I got access, but it's guarded.</p>
<p>Yes, exactly.</p>
<p>I mean, I've always.</p>
<p>I can't understand it or, you know, what.</p>
<p>I've always referred to,</p>
<p>like security controls as safety nets</p>
<p>being like, hey, if something bad happens,</p>
<p>this will protect you.</p>
<p>And so we've never really evaluated</p>
<p>the safety net in the aspect of security.</p>
<p>So we've always said like,</p>
<p>hey, this is possible.</p>
<p>You probably shouldn't care</p>
<p>if there's a safety net or not.</p>
<p>Like this is something that's bad</p>
<p>that could happen</p>
<p>and I don't want to rely on that</p>
<p>safety net.</p>
<p>You should rely on the actual posture</p>
<p>of it in general without kind of falling.</p>
<p>So we would address those things first</p>
<p>to make sure you never have to leverage</p>
<p>the safety net.</p>
<p>But now we're at least kind of considering</p>
<p>whether or not the safety</p>
<p>nets exist and how strong they are</p>
<p>and can they help you?</p>
<p>Because now we actually have that insight</p>
<p>through our cyber observer</p>
<p>acquisition.</p>
<p>That's pretty cool.</p>
<p>That's</p>
<p>that's a nice addition for you guys.</p>
<p>Another thing that comes to mind,</p>
<p>I don't know if you guys handled this.</p>
<p>It's micro segmentation motion</p>
<p>or controlled.</p>
<p>I'm talking to a company</p>
<p>now called Felicity.</p>
<p>Really cool stuff</p>
<p>where they're controlling at layer two</p>
<p>and layer three where they're saying,</p>
<p>I'm getting rid of VLANs completely</p>
<p>and I'm controlling</p>
<p>traffic between devices directly.</p>
<p>Do you guys bring that into play too?</p>
<p>Like on the networking side</p>
<p>in micro segmentation or or you say, now</p>
<p>I got access and if these two machines</p>
<p>can talk, you're, you're yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So we do play in that space</p>
<p>kind of when you're talking about like</p>
<p>the targeted use case, that would be one</p>
<p>where it's saying like, hey, I want to see</p>
<p>like how well my micro or macro</p>
<p>segmentation is actually in our help.</p>
<p>So yeah, we do take that into account.</p>
<p>The way that we do it is most of the time</p>
<p>if we are saying</p>
<p>that there is some sort of attack</p>
<p>that's happening between two machines</p>
<p>or there's a vulnerability being exploited</p>
<p>between two machines, we'll</p>
<p>look at the relevant</p>
<p>port number that that service runs on</p>
<p>and the exploit that it's running on.</p>
<p>And we will attempt to,</p>
<p>through a handshake to see like, hey,</p>
<p>can I talk on that appropriate</p>
<p>port number?</p>
<p>We don't pass</p>
<p>any data, there's no exploit happening,</p>
<p>but we are confirming connectivity.</p>
<p>So whether you're using a Lumia</p>
<p>or guard, a call or whatever,</p>
<p>the micro or macro segmentation</p>
<p>the solution is,</p>
<p>we will be aware of those controls</p>
<p>and that limitation.</p>
<p>So that way</p>
<p>if there is a vulnerable service running,</p>
<p>we will have insight into,</p>
<p>hey, these are the only three machines</p>
<p>in the environment</p>
<p>that actually exploit that vulnerability</p>
<p>because of those controls.</p>
<p>All that that is says, Yeah, cool,</p>
<p>you guys have some really amazing</p>
<p>technology.</p>
<p>Yeah, it's relevant and.</p>
<p>I. Would it's fun</p>
<p>because. Yeah, it's very real.</p>
<p>I'd be afraid to yeah, I'd be afraid</p>
<p>to release it on my own network.</p>
<p>I did that</p>
<p>when I first started at five or so.</p>
<p>I've got four kids.</p>
<p>I know you got a lot of kids.</p>
<p>And so it's one of those things</p>
<p>where I was able to see</p>
<p>which one of my kids machines puts</p>
<p>the most amount of risk to my network.</p>
<p>Is that storage device.</p>
<p>I've got a little synology device for</p>
<p>all of my critical stuff is sitting there.</p>
<p>So I built all the attack paths</p>
<p>and figured out that my daughter Rylan's</p>
<p>computer is a choke point</p>
<p>because of the way it was configured</p>
<p>so I fixed those</p>
<p>and then made it so that way.</p>
<p>At least all of the kids</p>
<p>computers risk are the same.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah.</p>
<p>Well, there you go.</p>
<p>You want to be an equal, equal opportunity</p>
<p>parent, right?</p>
<p>All the kids computers are.</p>
<p>Definitely especially the games.</p>
<p>They play the same</p>
<p>the same amount of risk.</p>
<p>Hey, Paul has been a pleasure.</p>
<p>This has been wonderful.</p>
<p>I learn. I learned a lot.</p>
<p>We may probably have to have.</p>
<p>You kind of love that. Yeah.</p>
<p>Cause I especially. I want to go.</p>
<p>I really want to go deeper into OT</p>
<p>because that's that's</p>
<p>a scary part for a lot of people today.</p>
<p>And I'm like I said before, I'm</p>
<p>doing a lot of research in this</p>
<p>in this area right now.</p>
<p>I have a lot of customers bugging</p>
<p>me. Darren, what do I do?</p>
<p>What do I do?</p>
<p>So we most</p>
<p>definitively need to talk again.</p>
<p>Okay. Yeah.</p>
<p>Next time, maybe I'll even pull up</p>
<p>in a use case and show you the interface.</p>
<p>And with those two scenarios,</p>
<p>that'd be fun.</p>
<p>Oh that, that would,</p>
<p>that would be awesome.</p>
