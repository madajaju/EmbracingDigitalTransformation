<p>﻿1</p>
<p>Hello, this</p>
<p>is Darren Pulsipher, chief solution</p>
<p>architect of public sector at Intel.</p>
<p>And welcome to Embracing</p>
<p>Digital Transformation,</p>
<p>where we investigate effective change,</p>
<p>leveraging people, process</p>
<p>and technology.</p>
<p>On today's episode,</p>
<p>Advanced comes on the edge with Dr.</p>
<p>Anna Scott and Leland Brown.</p>
<p>Anna Leland, welcome to the show.</p>
<p>Hey, Darren. Thank you.</p>
<p>You are both not newcomers.</p>
<p>Leland, you've been on the show twice now</p>
<p>and Anna is a regular now.</p>
<p>And Leland,</p>
<p>you're technical director of advanced</p>
<p>comms at Intel and those of, you know Dr.</p>
<p>Hannah Scott,</p>
<p>she's our chief edge architect</p>
<p>for Public Sector Intel.</p>
<p>Guys,</p>
<p>it's always a pleasure to have you on.</p>
<p>Normally, I'd say introduce yourselves,</p>
<p>but everyone already knows you.</p>
<p>Well,</p>
<p>yeah, I'd say Darren, as like</p>
<p>I said the last time, you</p>
<p>one of my favorite people</p>
<p>to work with at Intel.</p>
<p>And now you have another person</p>
<p>I'll always love to work with, Anna Scott,</p>
<p>so this would be a great time for me.</p>
<p>So let's, let's yeah, let's start off</p>
<p>by talking</p>
<p>about the history</p>
<p>of advanced communications in general.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>I don't want you feeling you're the man</p>
<p>here when it comes to advanced comms.</p>
<p>Let's not go all the way back</p>
<p>to the telegraph, but let's go back.</p>
<p>Let's let's take a little step back.</p>
<p>Okay, great.</p>
<p>So, you know, when you think about</p>
<p>cellular technology, you may</p>
<p>if you want to talk about communications</p>
<p>and what's really when someone thinks of</p>
<p>communicating now, they're not thinking</p>
<p>about a phone or a desk,</p>
<p>you know, or some type of hit,</p>
<p>you know, device move.</p>
<p>That's like old bell phone.</p>
<p>They're really thinking</p>
<p>about a cell phone.</p>
<p>So where did it start?</p>
<p>You know, we're going back to maybe</p>
<p>very late seventies, early eighties.</p>
<p>Know, we got into something called APTs,</p>
<p>Advanced Mobile</p>
<p>Public Service, I believe it was</p>
<p>that what was he</p>
<p>and stood for around 81</p>
<p>if you had the ability to make a voice</p>
<p>call,</p>
<p>you were the greatest person</p>
<p>on the planet.</p>
<p>If you could sit in your phone,</p>
<p>sit in your car and,</p>
<p>you know, make a call like you were like</p>
<p>the coolest person running around.</p>
<p>I actually had a back phone in my car</p>
<p>when I was in my early twenties and very</p>
<p>I thought I was rich.</p>
<p>No, I wasn't rich.</p>
<p>I just got a back phone, you know,</p>
<p>it was like a cell phone in a car.</p>
<p>But did you mean. Wait, wait, wait.</p>
<p>We Leland, you got to back up.</p>
<p>Did you milk that? I hope you milked that.</p>
<p>Oh, no.</p>
<p>Yeah, I mean, I really.</p>
<p>I just want to make sure, man. Oh, yeah.</p>
<p>Mean college and things like, man,</p>
<p>what's going on?</p>
<p>But, you know, it was it was really</p>
<p>if you were able to make a call</p>
<p>that was like</p>
<p>the greatest thing I could call.</p>
<p>Now, of course, as you know, luxuries</p>
<p>once tasted, you know, become,</p>
<p>you know, a necessity.</p>
<p>So the necessity to make a call</p>
<p>and a requirement to make a call</p>
<p>when the cell phone became the foundation.</p>
<p>And if you couldn't make it, as things</p>
<p>went on into what we call 2G,</p>
<p>which is more our time division</p>
<p>more two more multi access</p>
<p>type type of technologies</p>
<p>I think GMC may have</p>
<p>I'm sorry, GSM may have kind of kicked</p>
<p>in around that time period.</p>
<p>You were getting more into, well,</p>
<p>can you text, you know, can we make phone</p>
<p>calls and text, you know,</p>
<p>maybe early nineties time time period</p>
<p>when 2G was starting to really kick in</p>
<p>and of course, again,</p>
<p>that became a necessity call text.</p>
<p>Okay, maybe playing SMS on a phone</p>
<p>where phones went from this, making phone</p>
<p>calls, see, turn it to device</p>
<p>you can do a little bit of games.</p>
<p>You know that game called Snake on over</p>
<p>if anybody remembers.</p>
<p>Oh yeah, I was good enough. Snake.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>It's not I mean that</p>
<p>that was really the time period</p>
<p>where 2G was starting to turn the phone</p>
<p>into something a little more and</p>
<p>and down buttons and making the call.</p>
<p>And you got to 3G and 3G</p>
<p>brought on the ability</p>
<p>to do some nascent data capabilities.</p>
<p>What I mean by</p>
<p>that is the Internet was in its early</p>
<p>stages, late nineties, early 2000.</p>
<p>Can you do the same thing on the phone</p>
<p>and you want to talk about call?</p>
<p>I actually had a phone.</p>
<p>It was it was a flip phone.</p>
<p>I will be called a clamshell phone</p>
<p>where I found it.</p>
<p>The ability</p>
<p>to take the take a dongle connected</p>
<p>into my PC, a slot on my laptop.</p>
<p>And if you type £10, seven, seven, seven,</p>
<p>it gave you direct access</p>
<p>to Sprint's data network.</p>
<p>And from there, I was able to have</p>
<p>my laptop be a mobile device.</p>
<p>You know,</p>
<p>we take advantage of Wi-Fi nowadays.</p>
<p>That did not exist back then.</p>
<p>So it was really cool.</p>
<p>I mean, believe me, I was you know,</p>
<p>I was dating at the time of Give a girl,</p>
<p>hey, you know, you want do your work.</p>
<p>So how can I did I got you hooked up.</p>
<p>So, you know, it was it was really cool.</p>
<p>But think about it.</p>
<p>That was very I mean, very minimal.</p>
<p>I mean, maybe DSL speeds,</p>
<p>if that modem speeds really</p>
<p>that I</p>
<p>was able to manipulate the system</p>
<p>to going to give me data only calls</p>
<p>that we take for granted nowadays</p>
<p>with this phone can do</p>
<p>you know we take take take me</p>
<p>you take it for granted</p>
<p>you know what what smartphones can do back</p>
<p>then that didn't exist</p>
<p>now after 3G,</p>
<p>we transitioned into 2</p>
<p>to 2 areas of scope,</p>
<p>a unified standard, meaning that</p>
<p>then you had CDMA, Qualcomm, you had GSM,</p>
<p>you know, and you had the carriers back</p>
<p>then that existed Sprint.</p>
<p>And the time may be Bell of Manticore</p>
<p>probably just starting</p>
<p>to turn into Verizon.</p>
<p>More on a C CDMA track.</p>
<p>You had T-Mobile</p>
<p>when you had AT&T on a GSM track,</p>
<p>primarily 4G converged it into one</p>
<p>LTE under 3G p.</p>
<p>Okay. That evolved</p>
<p>standard turned where</p>
<p>every carrier started to adopt,</p>
<p>you know,</p>
<p>a common standard across the board.</p>
<p>Now, we could talk about WiMAX as a whole</p>
<p>nother long term discussion.</p>
<p>Everybody went to LTE primarily,</p>
<p>and that's when you saw</p>
<p>the proliferation of broadband.</p>
<p>If you think about companies</p>
<p>like Amazon, Netflix,</p>
<p>over all the platforms you to Google,</p>
<p>Facebook, everyone that there are common</p>
<p>now for us you take away the smartphone,</p>
<p>you take away broadband</p>
<p>and in the hand will not exist at all.</p>
<p>I give full 4G credit</p>
<p>for really proliferating</p>
<p>the advancement of our economy</p>
<p>through to the 20 tens.</p>
<p>Without 4G, we have.</p>
<p>Okay,</p>
<p>so now 4G has been out for a long time.</p>
<p>now's physically right. Mm.</p>
<p>So that's where we're at today is 5G.</p>
<p>So I have a tendency to</p>
<p>state this in terms of the carriers</p>
<p>and what they've deployed.</p>
<p>And anyone who see CCS seizes a podcast,</p>
<p>it may have some discussion points</p>
<p>for me about this guy</p>
<p>willing to defend it.</p>
<p>They're a part of the same spec line</p>
<p>release 14</p>
<p>in what we call 4G LTE advanced</p>
<p>release, 15</p>
<p>kicks in what we call 5G in or.</p>
<p>Right. And that crossover,</p>
<p>if we really think think about it,</p>
<p>there's a business objective there</p>
<p>and there's also a strategy</p>
<p>to try to adopt the new technology</p>
<p>as a part of the standard.</p>
<p>The business objective is</p>
<p>a lot of companies have already invested</p>
<p>into their 4G networks.</p>
<p>So the current evolved packet core</p>
<p>and in the current ran</p>
<p>components of the 4G</p>
<p>network are still in place.</p>
<p>You're adding in our 5G ran</p>
<p>box that has a different frequency</p>
<p>but still connected</p>
<p>back to the 4G core,</p>
<p>something that we call Non-Standalone.</p>
<p>So it wasn't so 5G,</p>
<p>correct me if I'm wrong</p>
<p>because I may be completely off,</p>
<p>but 4G was revolutionary</p>
<p>because it really unlocked and it required</p>
<p>it required new equipment,</p>
<p>completely new equipment,</p>
<p>new standard 5G is more evolutionary, but</p>
<p>it unlocks a whole bunch of new things.</p>
<p>But the underlying technology</p>
<p>is based on the same</p>
<p>type of hardware, same core.</p>
<p>That the underlying technology</p>
<p>is based upon the same standard.</p>
<p>I mean, example,</p>
<p>instead of having a bandwidth</p>
<p>of 20 megahertz within your air interface,</p>
<p>This parts of the modulation scheme</p>
<p>that that 4G provides</p>
<p>and I'm sorry, 5G provides in the</p>
<p>in the air interface,</p>
<p>but the architecture is is different</p>
<p>is virtualized under 5G as compared</p>
<p>to more proprietary under 4G.</p>
<p>And that leads to a lot of capabilities</p>
<p>that you're starting to see</p>
<p>become a part of the 5G deployments.</p>
<p>One example I like to give,</p>
<p>when the carrier deployed a 4G network,</p>
<p>they deployed it by putting a ramp box</p>
<p>right next to a old 3G box.</p>
<p>that you can now</p>
<p>have voice as a part of the data session.</p>
<p>And a lot of companies kept their 3G boxes</p>
<p>like Sprint for years,</p>
<p>kept their CDMA network up.</p>
<p>I think they just turned it down once.</p>
<p>Wants to do once more</p>
<p>where they had a had purchased them.</p>
<p>But in reality, 4G was just another box</p>
<p>sitting next to the 3G box.</p>
<p>As 5G takes that proprietary box</p>
<p>and it gives you the ability to</p>
<p>to to spread the functions of that box</p>
<p>across a virtualized network function.</p>
<p>Meaning</p>
<p>what is a part of what we call the base</p>
<p>band of 5G can now be software</p>
<p>defined in scale to multiple areas</p>
<p>as compared to being contained</p>
<p>into one site or one box or or one.</p>
<p>So that means I can add new functionality</p>
<p>to my network</p>
<p>without going out and replacing hardware.</p>
<p>That's what I just heard.</p>
<p>You can, but as you go into standalone,</p>
<p>standalone networks, it's a term</p>
<p>stand alone.</p>
<p>Now you can take a 5G network</p>
<p>and do something on premise or on site.</p>
<p>Example, if you have a skyscraper</p>
<p>instead of depending upon the network</p>
<p>coverage from a antenna sitting outside</p>
<p>where the core is sitting back at,</p>
<p>let's say the carriers,</p>
<p>you know, switch to switch station</p>
<p>what have you,</p>
<p>you can now develop an on premise network</p>
<p>built within that building</p>
<p>that proliferates coverage</p>
<p>and data services throughout because it's</p>
<p>now on premise, the standalone.</p>
<p>So 5G also it sounds like helped me</p>
<p>privatize</p>
<p>I'd had enough that</p>
<p>that's not the right word but</p>
<p>it kind of is I can own my own</p>
<p>I can have my own network inside my house.</p>
<p>I have a my own 5G</p>
<p>network inside my building in a shipyard.</p>
<p>We've talked about this and</p>
<p>so this</p>
<p>opens up a whole lot of new capabilities.</p>
<p>And a whole lot new capabilities.</p>
<p>Use cases in enables</p>
<p>new players in the space.</p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p>You know, we've been used to having two</p>
<p>or three strong players</p>
<p>in the space for a while now,</p>
<p>throughout the generations.</p>
<p>Now, those players have changed.</p>
<p>Now we have two or three primary</p>
<p>strong players with in the U.S.</p>
<p>You know, if you go all across</p>
<p>across the world, it's more of course,</p>
<p>but it enables new players to come in</p>
<p>and enables</p>
<p>new business verticals</p>
<p>to come into this area.</p>
<p>It also enables the federal government,</p>
<p>the Defense Department and the like</p>
<p>to start to adopt the technology</p>
<p>for their for for their own use.</p>
<p>Cases have more of a flexibility</p>
<p>in terms of the adoption</p>
<p>as compared to being highly dependent</p>
<p>upon the carriers.</p>
<p>Okay. Yeah, yeah.</p>
<p>I mean, he just set this up for you,</p>
<p>knock it out of the park.</p>
<p>He just said, Hey,</p>
<p>we can do anything you want, basically.</p>
<p>How does that affect the edge?</p>
<p>Our edge architectures?</p>
<p>Yeah, it gets pretty interesting.</p>
<p>And so one thing that Leland</p>
<p>hadn't touched on that also was change</p>
<p>within the same time frame is how Spectrum</p>
<p>has been managed and allocated, right?</p>
<p>So one of the most powerful things</p>
<p>we've said is now you've got</p>
<p>the ability for new players to come in.</p>
<p>We also have all these new</p>
<p>on prem capabilities, these.</p>
<p>But the other thing that is, is really</p>
<p>opening up the world in the U.S.</p>
<p>and granted, it's</p>
<p>a slightly different picture</p>
<p>with respect to the spectrum management</p>
<p>in other parts of the world is we now</p>
<p>have the ability to use cbrs spectrum</p>
<p>and there's somewhat of a complex way</p>
<p>that they they manage that.</p>
<p>But there is a non-priority portion</p>
<p>of that you can just use</p>
<p>without paying for it</p>
<p>and that and then there's</p>
<p>actually a priority that you can buy</p>
<p>if you want to kind of look up</p>
<p>the assuredly that it's going to be there</p>
<p>when you need it.</p>
<p>That's Navy spectrum.</p>
<p>So as you can imagine,</p>
<p>there's quite a few places in the U.S.</p>
<p>where where you think</p>
<p>that you can have that spectrum, use it</p>
<p>and not have too much</p>
<p>disruptive disruption.</p>
<p>And so what we're seeing</p>
<p>is some really cool things where large</p>
<p>manufacturing</p>
<p>facilities are using CBRE spectrum,</p>
<p>either working with a major carrier</p>
<p>that is not</p>
<p>then charging them for the spectrum</p>
<p>because they're using TV or else</p>
<p>or working with a new entrant</p>
<p>who is just saying we'll use Cbrs, set up</p>
<p>a total on prem standalone network,</p>
<p>and now you can use that</p>
<p>for everything that you want to do</p>
<p>in your manufacturing environment.</p>
<p>And so that's a very different model</p>
<p>because there are especially</p>
<p>with manufacturing,</p>
<p>there are some real advantages to</p>
<p>the wavelength</p>
<p>and the complexity of the systems</p>
<p>that you can set up with 5G that actually</p>
<p>have advantages over wi fi.</p>
<p>So I was going.</p>
<p>To ask you</p>
<p>why not my wi fi in my in my farm, right.</p>
<p>Or in my factory?</p>
<p>And you still can.</p>
<p>And there's still some advantages.</p>
<p>But what we see is especially</p>
<p>if you're moving really large pieces of</p>
<p>metal around, setting up a robust wi fi</p>
<p>network can be really, really challenging.</p>
<p>So, you know, if you have the same</p>
<p>configuration of your space</p>
<p>and you never change that,</p>
<p>then go with wi fi, wi fi six,</p>
<p>especially if the economics work for you.</p>
<p>But when you've got a complex environment</p>
<p>that you are reshuffling</p>
<p>on a regular basis, or like I say,</p>
<p>if your air if you do aircraft right</p>
<p>and you're moving very large pieces</p>
<p>of metal around,</p>
<p>having a 5G network is very, very useful.</p>
<p>I should be super careful and say often</p>
<p>what we're still seeing is that 4G</p>
<p>LTE is sufficient</p>
<p>and there hasn't been a full on the move</p>
<p>over into 5G spectrum</p>
<p>because you can use Cbrs with 4G as well.</p>
<p>So there's</p>
<p>there's still a movement,</p>
<p>but a lot of it is like the ecosystem</p>
<p>from a user equipment</p>
<p>standpoint isn't nearly as developed</p>
<p>and doesn't have nearly the options</p>
<p>that you have.</p>
<p>On the political side.</p>
<p>I know you can buy a laptop with 5G,</p>
<p>but it's heard about phone.</p>
<p>I've never bought one.</p>
<p>And do you guys think it'll ever</p>
<p>get to the point where wi fi and</p>
<p>and the advanced in the 5G</p>
<p>or maybe it's six G where they'll converge</p>
<p>where I can go buy a router myself,</p>
<p>you know, like the router I have,</p>
<p>you know, in my house for four,</p>
<p>my Wi-Fi six.</p>
<p>Will I be able to buy a 5G router?</p>
<p>So you kind of what you kind of seeing</p>
<p>it now, right?</p>
<p>This does a</p>
<p>I'll ask you two things</p>
<p>I'll get back to and his point as well.</p>
<p>There's something within</p>
<p>FI just called fixed wireless access.</p>
<p>To be quite honest,</p>
<p>Verizon and a couple of other companies</p>
<p>are deploying.</p>
<p>I think even T-Mobile is doing this,</p>
<p>deploying boxes</p>
<p>that you can set up in your house</p>
<p>and gives you access to their network.</p>
<p>It gives you basically wi</p>
<p>fi services in your house.</p>
<p>Just say go</p>
<p>Yeah, but it's not.</p>
<p>It's receiving 5G.</p>
<p>Right, right. It is transferring it.</p>
<p>Yeah, it is receiving 5G</p>
<p>transforming into wi fi in your house</p>
<p>and giving you Wi-Fi access, meaning</p>
<p>from a standard.</p>
<p>You think we'll ever get to that point</p>
<p>where all have a 5G network or six network</p>
<p>in my house instead of wi fi</p>
<p>or does that matter?</p>
<p>I do asking are they converging or No,</p>
<p>they're very separate, separate</p>
<p>use cases and all that.</p>
<p>In many ways, you you kind of do</p>
<p>have that, right.</p>
<p>I mean, let's face it, you're you're</p>
<p>your house is a multi may house.</p>
<p>You have 5G coming</p>
<p>in, converging into why, why, why, why fi.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>You also have cellular coming in</p>
<p>but your phones.</p>
<p>So depending upon</p>
<p>how you have your devices set up, you're</p>
<p>either on the certain the certain network</p>
<p>directly or you're using</p>
<p>wi fi through of through</p>
<p>a fixed wireless access point.</p>
<p>So it's and</p>
<p>and also if I have Bluetooth know right.</p>
<p>If I have.</p>
<p>I didn't know I was so advanced</p>
<p>I'm super advanced.</p>
<p>But it to the point you know</p>
<p>and getting back to this point</p>
<p>around devices very true</p>
<p>demand drives</p>
<p>change 4G was nothing wrong with it</p>
<p>you know I can do broadband on 4G,</p>
<p>watch Netflix and everything</p>
<p>I'm very comfortable with</p>
<p>and I've asked these questions</p>
<p>and some discussed in the past.</p>
<p>Are you are</p>
<p>you satisfied with your 4G phone</p>
<p>and most people say, yeah,</p>
<p>so why go to 5G?</p>
<p>What is the advantage of the end user</p>
<p>to transition over to 5G?</p>
<p>I have a tendency to think that 5G</p>
<p>is the value that it brings,</p>
<p>isn't necessarily the fact that you get</p>
<p>higher data rates and lower</p>
<p>latency at the end user point is the fact</p>
<p>that you cheat, that you can now provide</p>
<p>those services at a broad scale across</p>
<p>because it's virtualized.</p>
<p>Did it the system,</p>
<p>the network architecture is very software</p>
<p>intensive as compared to 4G,</p>
<p>which is more proprietary boxes</p>
<p>and still based on hardware.</p>
<p>It has software.</p>
<p>So based on hardware, primarily,</p>
<p>this is a software intensive network</p>
<p>that can be virtualized in position</p>
<p>in many places.</p>
<p>As Anna stated, the frequency</p>
<p>portfolio for 5G is very dynamic.</p>
<p>You can utilize unlicensed bands, license</p>
<p>bands, CPRS.</p>
<p>So there's.</p>
<p>More, more options and more. Options.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>And I think that's where you'll see it.</p>
<p>If you look at, you know, some pictures.</p>
<p>So how you compare 4G to 5G,</p>
<p>which is seen</p>
<p>the pictures is 4G larger, so smaller</p>
<p>cells more more dependent</p>
<p>upon access points covering areas.</p>
<p>And then you'll see as a picture with 5G</p>
<p>where it'll show similar but underlay a</p>
<p>of different types of usage points</p>
<p>things devices that are sharing access.</p>
<p>I mean, let's face it, v2x architectures</p>
<p>that was a part of 4G,</p>
<p>but a part of that spec was never used</p>
<p>and 5G is heavily used, looked at.</p>
<p>Now it's been adopted and deployed</p>
<p>because it's virtualize.</p>
<p>We've taken away</p>
<p>some of the barriers of entry,</p>
<p>if you will, to utilize</p>
<p>in that part of spectrum.</p>
<p>You go to virtualized architecture.</p>
<p>Yeah, very, very fascinating stuff.</p>
