<p>ï»¿1</p>
<p>Hello, this</p>
<p>is Darren Pulsipher chief solution</p>
<p>architect of public sector at Intel.</p>
<p>And welcome to Embracing</p>
<p>Digital Transformation,</p>
<p>where we investigate effective change,</p>
<p>leveraging people, process</p>
<p>and technology.</p>
<p>On today's episode,</p>
<p>Intel's superheroes with Cameron Chehreh,</p>
<p>VP and general manager of Intel's</p>
<p>Public Sector.</p>
<p>Cameron, welcome to the show.</p>
<p>Darren Thank you.</p>
<p>It's always a pleasure to be able</p>
<p>to share some airtime with you.</p>
<p>Hey, when we when we first talked</p>
<p>about superpowers and superheroes,</p>
<p>I thought of something that my family did</p>
<p>for Christmas cards</p>
<p>this last year, all 17 of us,</p>
<p>because I got ten kids.</p>
<p>There's a boatload of kids there.</p>
<p>We did a Christmas card of superheroes.</p>
<p>I'll have to</p>
<p>you guys will see the picture.</p>
<p>It'll show up on the podcast video.</p>
<p>Check it out.</p>
<p>It's pretty funny, but we're not talking</p>
<p>about my family superheroes.</p>
<p>Today we're talking about Intel's public</p>
<p>sector superheroes and their superpowers.</p>
<p>I love it there and so excited.</p>
<p>So, Karen, let's first talk about you.</p>
<p>Let's give a just a brief background</p>
<p>on where you come from</p>
<p>because you're new to Intel</p>
<p>and you bring some new insight</p>
<p>into Intel and some energy</p>
<p>into the public sector team their thing.</p>
<p>Darren, thank you.</p>
<p>So as everyone mentioned, as you</p>
<p>mentioned, my name is Cameron Chehreh.</p>
<p>I come to Intel very humbly</p>
<p>and honestly through</p>
<p>what I would like to think</p>
<p>is a pretty interesting career.</p>
<p>Darren, but I'll let you and your audience</p>
<p>judge that.</p>
<p>I started my career humbly</p>
<p>working for the world's</p>
<p>largest privately owned staffing company.</p>
<p>What that introduced me</p>
<p>to was a passion for technology.</p>
<p>I had no idea where I was introduced to it</p>
<p>a software application called PeopleSoft</p>
<p>that I became very fond of</p>
<p>and ended up learning pretty quickly.</p>
<p>What that led to was</p>
<p>an extraordinary opportunity</p>
<p>for me to help build</p>
<p>the world's first cloud computing company,</p>
<p>the company in Annapolis called UC Center</p>
<p>Networking</p>
<p>and I think</p>
<p>were really kind of ahead of our time.</p>
<p>So much so, Darren, that seven</p>
<p>or eight years</p>
<p>before the term cloud was coined,</p>
<p>I'll never forget the night we were having</p>
<p>a few adult beverages sitting in Posers</p>
<p>Pub in downtown Annapolis,</p>
<p>and we created the tagline</p>
<p>Software as a service.</p>
<p>Now here's the context.</p>
<p>That's I a little bit.</p>
<p>So that's pretty cool.</p>
<p>And then I seem to have found my way</p>
<p>through private equity working for</p>
<p>federal systems integrators like Northrop</p>
<p>Grumman and General Dynamics,</p>
<p>where I really caught the passion</p>
<p>for supporting a mission.</p>
<p>And that's really what drove me through</p>
<p>those companies was really supporting</p>
<p>just the amazing people</p>
<p>and customers within public sector.</p>
<p>I've also been the chief technology</p>
<p>officer</p>
<p>at Dell Technologies for a spell,</p>
<p>and now very proudly and humbly,</p>
<p>I've got the great honor to lead</p>
<p>just an amazing, small</p>
<p>but mighty team here at Intel.</p>
<p>Public Sector.</p>
<p>All right, Cameron,</p>
<p>so why why did you come over to Intel?</p>
<p>I mean, you were a Dell, right?</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>In the Casa CTO job as a cool job, right?</p>
<p>I've been there myself.</p>
<p>It's a fun job, great technology,</p>
<p>drive and drive and tech.</p>
<p>But now you take on a big whopper of a</p>
<p>of a position</p>
<p>at Intel, as you know,</p>
<p>general manager and public sector.</p>
<p>Why why would you do that?</p>
<p>You know, it's it's interesting.</p>
<p>Darren Dell's a great company.</p>
<p>I had an amazing job.</p>
<p>They're really, really great customers.</p>
<p>Just a marquee brand.</p>
<p>When Pat Gelsinger decided</p>
<p>to leave VMware</p>
<p>and come back to Intel, all I.</p>
<p>I felt the earth shake, you know, been</p>
<p>in this industry a long time.</p>
<p>And if you haven't followed</p>
<p>just the incredible</p>
<p>career of Pat Gelsinger,</p>
<p>but also our great company,</p>
<p>you had to have been a sleeper</p>
<p>under a rock.</p>
<p>If you didn't feel the earth shake</p>
<p>and I took notice.</p>
<p>Pat came back.</p>
<p>He started to build a little bit</p>
<p>of a leadership team, and he brought</p>
<p>on Greg Lavender, who's</p>
<p>another icon in the industry</p>
<p>and another person that I admire very much</p>
<p>based on their leadership,</p>
<p>their ability to drive teams</p>
<p>and change and transformation.</p>
<p>And although I loved my job at Dell</p>
<p>and still still do to this day,</p>
<p>I felt a calling because what I saw</p>
<p>Pat doing was looking to reinvigorate</p>
<p>an iconic American brand that,</p>
<p>quite frankly,</p>
<p>did a brilliant job innovating,</p>
<p>built an industry around our technology.</p>
<p>We just seem to have lost our way</p>
<p>because of a lack of leadership</p>
<p>for for a period of time.</p>
<p>And when you get a leader</p>
<p>that takes the helm of a company</p>
<p>like Pat Gelsinger,</p>
<p>you know, things are going to happen.</p>
<p>And so I heard that calling</p>
<p>and I was very, very interested.</p>
<p>I've been a partner and</p>
<p>a customer of Intel for many, many years.</p>
<p>Huge fan of the technology</p>
<p>growing up in operations,</p>
<p>because, look, there's competitors</p>
<p>out there and I love our competitors there</p>
<p>and they keep</p>
<p>us sharp and and on our toes.</p>
<p>But they're not Intel.</p>
<p>We're the company</p>
<p>that put the Silicon in Silicon Valley.</p>
<p>You know, we are an iconic American brand.</p>
<p>And I heard the calling</p>
<p>and I wanted to be part of the work</p>
<p>it was going to take</p>
<p>to get us back to that that brand status.</p>
<p>So yeah, you like hard things, don't you?</p>
<p>Darren Not only do I love a challenge,</p>
<p>but I believe in the underdogs</p>
<p>and the underdog story.</p>
<p>There's amazing people at Intel.</p>
<p>They don't realize they're all amazing,</p>
<p>which is the greatest part of all of it,</p>
<p>because they have such humility</p>
<p>and humbleness.</p>
<p>But there's amazing people here.</p>
<p>We're doing some extraordinary things.</p>
<p>We have a great business and people</p>
<p>do the right thing all the time.</p>
<p>And you don't find</p>
<p>that often in companies.</p>
<p>And the fact that we're rooted in</p>
<p>that culturally is inspiring.</p>
<p>So let's talk.</p>
<p>I mean, Pat Pat has been talking to us</p>
<p>and we've taken that</p>
<p>into the public sector</p>
<p>quite a bit on intel superpowers.</p>
<p>And I think there's even more</p>
<p>than the four that Pat talks about,</p>
<p>especially in public sector.</p>
<p>Let's talk a little bit</p>
<p>about those superpowers and how</p>
<p>that's helping public sector.</p>
<p>Who are so first of all, we recognize.</p>
<p>Right, what what are the four superpowers</p>
<p>as we see them and why do we think</p>
<p>they have such a profound effect on on.</p>
<p>I'll say,</p>
<p>mankind and humanity in the world.</p>
<p>Right. When you think of</p>
<p>what's going on in the world.</p>
<p>Ubiquitous compute.</p>
<p>So when you think of that,</p>
<p>it's pretty incredible.</p>
<p>Well, let me list the four so ubiquitous</p>
<p>compute ubiquitous comms I believe.</p>
<p>Right the network piece</p>
<p>of artificial intelligence.</p>
<p>And I'm going to forget</p>
<p>both the fourth one there and I always do.</p>
<p>And it's so right in front of me.</p>
<p>Edge.</p>
<p>Edge, the cloud.</p>
<p>It is the most pervasive thing</p>
<p>that I got to have a little bit of fun</p>
<p>with these podcasts, right? Yeah,</p>
<p>absolutely.</p>
<p>Making sure you were on your toes. Yeah.</p>
<p>Thanks for the test.</p>
<p>Let's look at ubiquitous compute to start.</p>
<p>You know, I always had an appreciation</p>
<p>being technical, but also a consumer.</p>
<p>That technology compute</p>
<p>really was everywhere in our life.</p>
<p>It wasn't until I joined Intel</p>
<p>that I realize the</p>
<p>the magnitude of the importance on society</p>
<p>that semiconductor has has.</p>
<p>For me, being an enterprise technologist,</p>
<p>it was always about,</p>
<p>you know, building data centers.</p>
<p>I got to build the Eastern Seaboard</p>
<p>of the Internet physically.</p>
<p>You know, about Al Gore.</p>
<p>I didn't invent the Internet.</p>
<p>Sure got it.</p>
<p>You know, but I never realized</p>
<p>until till I came here,</p>
<p>because my my orientation changed.</p>
<p>Semiconductors are in everything,</p>
<p>literally everything.</p>
<p>Cars, appliances,</p>
<p>smartphone cars, computers,</p>
<p>hospital health care systems, digital</p>
<p>wreck, literally semiconductors span</p>
<p>the ecosystem in just about every vertical</p>
<p>sized market on the planet.</p>
<p>And it is what is helping us</p>
<p>not only live the best human experience</p>
<p>we can live,</p>
<p>it's actually helping us</p>
<p>improve the quality of our lives.</p>
<p>It's giving us better</p>
<p>situational awareness, etc.</p>
<p>So ubiquitous compute</p>
<p>really means something to us</p>
<p>more than just</p>
<p>some cheeky marketing tagline.</p>
<p>Because we do recognize</p>
<p>when you look at that,</p>
<p>I'm saving people's lives</p>
<p>when I apply our superpower</p>
<p>to health care, I'm</p>
<p>protecting the homeland and civilians.</p>
<p>What I think of applying it</p>
<p>to a national security mission,</p>
<p>I'm helping improve and advance scientific</p>
<p>research</p>
<p>to look for things like cures for cancer.</p>
<p>Maybe have us</p>
<p>not just put a person on the moon,</p>
<p>but maybe live on the moon one day.</p>
<p>Who knows, right? One can dream.</p>
<p>So it's really extraordinary.</p>
<p>So that superpower in itself</p>
<p>is fascinating.</p>
<p>You know, it's interesting</p>
<p>because I think COVID and the pandemic</p>
<p>kind of put a magnifying glass on that.</p>
<p>When you</p>
<p>look at the sheer number of people</p>
<p>that were still able to work</p>
<p>and schools were still operating,</p>
<p>albeit not perfectly,</p>
<p>but our kids were still learning.</p>
<p>And now it's all because of Silicon.</p>
<p>Darren That comment.</p>
<p>I paused</p>
<p>because I wanted to let it linger there</p>
<p>for a moment, because of the power of what</p>
<p>you just said.</p>
<p>And yes, unfortunately, unfortunately,</p>
<p>it took the pandemic for us</p>
<p>to recognize the true value of it.</p>
<p>Now, I'm an optimist eternally.</p>
<p>I was I was, I guess, born an optimist.</p>
<p>I'm going to die an optimist.</p>
<p>And I'm even optimistic about dying.</p>
<p>Derek, let me be let me be clear about it,</p>
<p>but the pandemic truly showed us</p>
<p>the power of</p>
<p>when we can apply silicon for good use,</p>
<p>what it's done.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Because to your point, we shifted learning</p>
<p>from a kinetic environment, right?</p>
<p>Going to schools to a virtual one.</p>
<p>Well, there was a little bit of benefit</p>
<p>that got exposed to people that we never</p>
<p>realized, like closing the digital divide</p>
<p>a little bit more,</p>
<p>being able to fulfill that for, let's say,</p>
<p>people with disabilities</p>
<p>or being out of necessarily</p>
<p>been able to attend traditional schooling.</p>
<p>They're now offered this</p>
<p>this great digital format to participate</p>
<p>on an equal playing field.</p>
<p>And that's humbling because,</p>
<p>you know, to be able to help people</p>
<p>using what you do on a daily basis</p>
<p>as a job, there's nothing more fulfilling.</p>
<p>And I agree</p>
<p>with you, the pandemic really revealed</p>
<p>a lot of these things where digital now</p>
<p>is front and center in our lives.</p>
<p>You know, this brings on to the next</p>
<p>the next superpower,</p>
<p>which is the calm side of thing,</p>
<p>because if you just have silicon out there</p>
<p>without it being connected,</p>
<p>it doesn't it can't be it can't realize</p>
<p>all the potential they can have.</p>
<p>And we saw a huge uptick in comms and 5G,</p>
<p>kind of got a kick in the pants</p>
<p>which it needed to be adopted</p>
<p>with the pandemic as well.</p>
<p>And I'm glad you brought that up.</p>
<p>Even today, I've got a bunch</p>
<p>of high scores and three high schoolers.</p>
<p>They all have Chromebooks</p>
<p>now where before it was, well, you check</p>
<p>the Chromebook out for this one class</p>
<p>and you hand in at the end of class.</p>
<p>That's done.</p>
<p>Every student has a Chromebook now</p>
<p>in, I would say a majority</p>
<p>of the school districts out there today.</p>
<p>This was a this was a huge shift</p>
<p>and we're seeing teachers shift</p>
<p>to because of that connectivity.</p>
<p>So can you talk a little bit</p>
<p>about Intel's comms?</p>
<p>What are they doing in comms?</p>
<p>Yeah, so it's really interesting, Darren.</p>
<p>People look at us</p>
<p>as we're just this chip company.</p>
<p>I don't know if people understand</p>
<p>the entire portfolio</p>
<p>we have for interconnect right.</p>
<p>Because interconnect,</p>
<p>as you mentioned, is so important.</p>
<p>I mean, the work that we do out of our</p>
<p>any extra vision</p>
<p>and how we're connecting people</p>
<p>is the other superpower for a reason.</p>
<p>And to your point, look, there are times</p>
<p>and there are certainly mission scenarios</p>
<p>where we're disconnected,</p>
<p>where refer to superpower number one</p>
<p>makes it so important, because I can then</p>
<p>bring the technology closer to the data</p>
<p>and should let's say</p>
<p>I'll use a military example.</p>
<p>In this instance, you've got a warfighter,</p>
<p>what's called a DDL environment,</p>
<p>a disadvantaged</p>
<p>or a disconnected environment.</p>
<p>They're still able to use the compute</p>
<p>locally in the information</p>
<p>they have to be able to execute</p>
<p>on that mission when they reconnect</p>
<p>to whatever comms they're using,</p>
<p>whether it's legacy, 4G,</p>
<p>or some sort of wireless,</p>
<p>then they can continue to get better</p>
<p>connectivity</p>
<p>and up to date information</p>
<p>with regards to data, that's transmission.</p>
<p>But if I go to the education scenario</p>
<p>that you talked about there</p>
<p>and interconnect is vitally important,</p>
<p>you know, getting access</p>
<p>to data, the streaming,</p>
<p>the video content, everything else</p>
<p>is just so vitally important.</p>
<p>And I don't think people realize</p>
<p>just how powerful it can be.</p>
<p>Now we have gaps, right?</p>
<p>We still have areas of the country</p>
<p>and the world</p>
<p>that are not able to participate</p>
<p>in the digital economy.</p>
<p>What's fascinating is, and I'm sad to say,</p>
<p>this closing the digital divide in</p>
<p>the United States is becoming much harder</p>
<p>than it is in developing countries.</p>
<p>Developing</p>
<p>countries are able to leapfrog us</p>
<p>because they're investing in 5G, sexy,</p>
<p>you know, non terrestrial comms.</p>
<p>Now, there's issues</p>
<p>associated with that as well, but</p>
<p>they're able to invest in that</p>
<p>and close the digital divide much faster.</p>
<p>But to your point,</p>
<p>that superpower is equally as important</p>
<p>because let's face</p>
<p>it, connections is one of the fundamental</p>
<p>basis of being human</p>
<p>and being connected to others.</p>
<p>One of the most fulfilling things</p>
<p>you can do.</p>
<p>Oh, I totally agree.</p>
<p>And you mentioned a little bit about edge</p>
<p>to cloud, especially with the warfighter.</p>
<p>And this is dear to my heart, too,</p>
<p>because I've been doing a lot of work</p>
<p>in that digital environment</p>
<p>and architectures around digital.</p>
<p>Tell us a little bit more</p>
<p>about Intel's and their edge</p>
<p>to cloud strategy in that you know,</p>
<p>why is that important to us</p>
<p>and what do we have on the track to help</p>
<p>public sector in this space?</p>
<p>You know, Darren, it's fascinating.</p>
<p>Cloud and edge.</p>
<p>And, you know,</p>
<p>all these interesting trends</p>
<p>that come in in technology,</p>
<p>they have a profound effect on business</p>
<p>and on mission.</p>
<p>And I know people have talked about cloud</p>
<p>for a long time.</p>
<p>And it you know, people are like,</p>
<p>is it a fad?</p>
<p>Is it a trend?</p>
<p>Well, there's a big difference, right?</p>
<p>A fad is we're all not walking around</p>
<p>with mullets anymore, thank God.</p>
<p>Oh, no, they're coming back, man.</p>
<p>They're coming. Back.</p>
<p>Let's hope not. They're right.</p>
<p>But a trend.</p>
<p>And I mean, excuse me.</p>
<p>Yeah, a trend</p>
<p>rather than a fad is something</p>
<p>that has the opportunity</p>
<p>to help us progress</p>
<p>and grow and learn how to adopt</p>
<p>new methodologies and new things.</p>
<p>When I look at edge to cloud</p>
<p>because the underpinning capability</p>
<p>is compute and interconnect,</p>
<p>we play a significant role.</p>
<p>Now we have to do it with our our</p>
<p>ecosystem partners and our OEMs, right.</p>
<p>But edge to cloud what it provides</p>
<p>if you really harness</p>
<p>the true power of not only the silicon</p>
<p>but but software,</p>
<p>you can secure workloads,</p>
<p>you can do more high assured computing.</p>
<p>But what it affords you the opportunity</p>
<p>to do really is interoperability.</p>
<p>So I can move workloads from an edge</p>
<p>to to a cloud</p>
<p>or to a traditional data center</p>
<p>very seamlessly.</p>
<p>But I'm using open standards and</p>
<p>and core technologies</p>
<p>and that edge to cloud strategy.</p>
<p>And I would offer you, Darren,</p>
<p>you know, we've seen this in our industry.</p>
<p>Trends change.</p>
<p>You know, when we started many, many,</p>
<p>many years ago,</p>
<p>when computing was for the elite</p>
<p>and the educated,</p>
<p>it was mainframes and supercomputers,</p>
<p>because that's the only institution</p>
<p>that could afford them.</p>
<p>And that's that was okay. Right.</p>
<p>So it was this centralized model</p>
<p>that everyone logged into.</p>
<p>I'm old enough to remember, you know, 5270</p>
<p>Green screen emulators for mainframes.</p>
<p>Then it shifted to this client server,</p>
<p>so it became very decentralized.</p>
<p>Cloud comes about</p>
<p>and it goes back to a centralized,</p>
<p>geo segregated mainframe.</p>
<p>It's just modern. I know all the CCP's.</p>
<p>I love them, but and I know they hate</p>
<p>when I when I say that.</p>
<p>But it it's about a model,</p>
<p>an architectural construct.</p>
<p>It's not about the technology. Right.</p>
<p>With edge emerging,</p>
<p>I think what we're going to see</p>
<p>for the foreseeable future, the next 20,</p>
<p>what's going to really roll and dominate</p>
<p>because as we make things smarter,</p>
<p>we have to take and push the technology</p>
<p>out to the edge</p>
<p>where the information's</p>
<p>actually being created,</p>
<p>and then processing happens</p>
<p>in a centralized manner</p>
<p>for more analytics, air, etc..</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>We're not going to go backwards, right?</p>
<p>Cars aren't going to get dumber.</p>
<p>We're not going to make a gas powered</p>
<p>Tesla.</p>
<p>That right.</p>
<p>You know, now is a gas engine</p>
<p>and is not got cool</p>
<p>features and and gadgets and widgets.</p>
<p>Things are only going to progress.</p>
<p>They're going to get smarter.</p>
<p>So the edge is going to be extraordinarily</p>
<p>pervasive.</p>
<p>And as an industry, we're again</p>
<p>creating self-inflicted wounds.</p>
<p>We haven't done a good job</p>
<p>at defining what that is yet.</p>
<p>But but we know what's emerging.</p>
<p>Yeah, in fact, I kind of like</p>
<p>the data center without walls concept.</p>
<p>And where is my data?</p>
<p>My data is everywhere now.</p>
<p>And how do I make intelligent decisions</p>
<p>based off of all this</p>
<p>data collected and processed everywhere?</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>Including a cell phone</p>
<p>or a sensor or a camera</p>
<p>or in the industrial space,</p>
<p>in motors and pumps and things like that.</p>
<p>Those are becoming intelligent,</p>
<p>which leads to our next superpower,</p>
<p>artificial intelligence.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>And people don't know this about intel.</p>
<p>We have one of the largest</p>
<p>artificial intelligence portfolios</p>
<p>in the world.</p>
<p>Darren, this is why I love this company.</p>
<p>Humbleness and humility is is</p>
<p>a is a great cultural attribute to have.</p>
<p>But unfortunately, at times</p>
<p>it works a touch against us.</p>
<p>And I'm a little okay with that because I</p>
<p>do like being a cheerleader for the head.</p>
<p>Look, artificial intelligence.</p>
<p>Here's a few things that that people don't</p>
<p>know what might surprise them.</p>
<p>First of all, we have a software portfolio</p>
<p>that is extra ordinary.</p>
<p>We have more software developers</p>
<p>than some software companies.</p>
<p>And there's a need for that.</p>
<p>There's a reason, right?</p>
<p>Because, look, I love Greg Lavender.</p>
<p>What? He's such an amazing CTO.</p>
<p>He has this expression</p>
<p>that you have silicon, but</p>
<p>software is the soul of silicon, right?</p>
<p>You have to allow it to do something.</p>
<p>You have to give it life,</p>
<p>you have to give it a purpose.</p>
<p>And AI is a great example of it.</p>
<p>And and Darren, it's fascinating.</p>
<p>People say, oh, well, I all these tech</p>
<p>guys talk about AI, you know, what is it?</p>
<p>Are we going to have robots and all these?</p>
<p>Yeah, we're going to have them.</p>
<p>But let's talk about a practical use case.</p>
<p>I'm lost</p>
<p>in the UK, happens to be off the dirt.</p>
<p>As much as I love traveling the UK,</p>
<p>I travel all over the world</p>
<p>and I can't remember</p>
<p>half the cities I'm in, but I'm lost.</p>
<p>I pick up my phone and immediately</p>
<p>because GPS is coming down on my phone,</p>
<p>I could say,</p>
<p>Hey sir, Siri or Hey Google, I'm lost.</p>
<p>It brings up maps, a geo locates me,</p>
<p>finds me where the closest point</p>
<p>of civilization is.</p>
<p>That's just a practical way</p>
<p>of where I would apply for good</p>
<p>RS Doing profound things for us as people,</p>
<p>you know.</p>
<p>And look, I don't have a great sense</p>
<p>of direction there</p>
<p>and so I need a lot of help.</p>
<p>Now we're also seeing because Intel now</p>
<p>ubiquitous compute</p>
<p>and the advanced comms that we have,</p>
<p>we're seeing more of these edge</p>
<p>devices become intelligent</p>
<p>and we're actually decreasing</p>
<p>the amount of data that needs to move</p>
<p>off the edge and into the data centers.</p>
<p>Because we are running</p>
<p>AI algorithms to infer on the</p>
<p>edge what we're looking for.</p>
<p>And a</p>
<p>lot of people don't know</p>
<p>that we've got this kind of technology</p>
<p>and it's built into our CPU's directly.</p>
<p>And also we also have specialized</p>
<p>XP use, right neuromorphic processors</p>
<p>that do the same, same</p>
<p>sort of thing at lower wattage</p>
<p>and higher speeds,</p>
<p>which is pretty darn incredible.</p>
<p>You know, Darrell,</p>
<p>what I love about your podcast and this is</p>
<p>we can have a conversation</p>
<p>in English rather than geek speak,</p>
<p>because I think people need to remember</p>
<p>when we satisfy a mission,</p>
<p>you have to be able to understand</p>
<p>what you're doing</p>
<p>is an impact using the technology.</p>
<p>And you're absolutely correct.</p>
<p>I mean, look, I love our</p>
<p>IP use, our expertize, our GPUs, our CPUs.</p>
<p>It's pretty extraordinary what we can do.</p>
<p>But let's practically apply.</p>
<p>And if I go back</p>
<p>to, say, a civilian use case,</p>
<p>look at the Postal Service.</p>
<p>It's shocking to me.</p>
<p>Most people,</p>
<p>when they look at Postal Service,</p>
<p>they don't</p>
<p>they don't necessarily see on the surface</p>
<p>and an organization</p>
<p>that's innovative all there.</p>
<p>But when you see the next generation</p>
<p>delivery vehicles, the amount of sensors</p>
<p>that are on that thing</p>
<p>and what it's doing, it's as modern</p>
<p>as Google Street view the cars</p>
<p>driving around, mapping certain things.</p>
<p>When you look at Postal Service centers</p>
<p>that do mail sorting</p>
<p>how they're applying,</p>
<p>what you just described in our portfolio</p>
<p>down to these kinetic sorting machines</p>
<p>so that they're getting smarter</p>
<p>about where mail goes and safer</p>
<p>mail handling and all these other</p>
<p>extraordinarily positive things.</p>
<p>They're leveraging technology to scale.</p>
<p>And it's pretty extraordinary.</p>
<p>We look at other use cases, Darren.</p>
<p>I think of first responders,</p>
<p>you know, being able to put more silicon</p>
<p>in law enforcement</p>
<p>vehicles to do smarter things,</p>
<p>to create better situational awareness.</p>
<p>It's all about affecting the human</p>
<p>in that mission environment</p>
<p>in a more positive way, giving them</p>
<p>more access to the information,</p>
<p>but in a consumable,</p>
<p>humanly consumable format.</p>
<p>And Darren,</p>
<p>that's the piece we miss all the time</p>
<p>from an AI perspective,</p>
<p>we get so geeked up talking about the tech</p>
<p>we forget, like the simple example</p>
<p>I told you about in the UK before</p>
<p>in a few seconds</p>
<p>I can visually look at something</p>
<p>and ingest 600 different data points</p>
<p>within a split second.</p>
<p>Just visually</p>
<p>presenting the data effectively.</p>
<p>And when I look at a hardware</p>
<p>or software portfolio,</p>
<p>that's the power of what we do is Intel.</p>
<p>Now, look,</p>
<p>some of these things are aspirational.</p>
<p>What I love about our company</p>
<p>is we do bring a bag of parts</p>
<p>that are very relevant.</p>
<p>We have amazing partners in our ecosystem</p>
<p>that help us bring that together</p>
<p>to create real solutions that are</p>
<p>being very careful with my words here.</p>
<p>And then you've got partners</p>
<p>in the last mile, that critical last mile</p>
<p>that every customer needs us to help us</p>
<p>integrate those solutions</p>
<p>in that mission environment.</p>
<p>It it really is a great place in the</p>
<p>ecosystem to be because we are innovating.</p>
<p>So that's one thing</p>
<p>I, that's one thing I really want</p>
<p>to come up with our superheroes.</p>
<p>Our superheroes are our our employees</p>
<p>and our ecosystem.</p>
<p>Our apps.</p>
<p>And this is something</p>
<p>that always kind of shocked me.</p>
<p>We we have one of the most incredible</p>
<p>ecosystems to bring solutions to market.</p>
<p>And we don't even bring the solutions</p>
<p>to market.</p>
<p>We will.</p>
<p>And it's amazing</p>
<p>even some of our competitors</p>
<p>we work with to solve</p>
<p>really tough problems</p>
<p>for national defense</p>
<p>or for public service.</p>
<p>And I</p>
<p>think the reason why and one one reason</p>
<p>why I love this team that I work on in</p>
<p>public sector</p>
<p>is because we are making a difference</p>
<p>in lots of people's lives, day to day</p>
<p>lives.</p>
<p>The things that we're bringing</p>
<p>about today.</p>
<p>Well, Darren,</p>
<p>I mean, just a testament to that.</p>
<p>And I hope these people don't kill me,</p>
<p>but I need to mention them</p>
<p>because I admire them a lot.</p>
<p>Being able to hire</p>
<p>the people we've been able to hire,</p>
<p>like retired admirals</p>
<p>and generals and chief warrant officers.</p>
<p>You know, we've got an amazing team here</p>
<p>that helps us every single day.</p>
<p>Remember who we serve.</p>
<p>You know,</p>
<p>look, I'm very proud of our company</p>
<p>and proud of our tech, our innovations,</p>
<p>all these different things.</p>
<p>And I'm proud of our people.</p>
<p>But without those people helping,</p>
<p>we're helping us</p>
<p>remember that it's us and the ecosystem</p>
<p>we've created because we did create that.</p>
<p>Let's let's be very honest here</p>
<p>to serve this this great mission</p>
<p>and not just our government,</p>
<p>but governments worldwide and our allies</p>
<p>and all those things.</p>
<p>It's a pretty humbling experience.</p>
<p>But you're right,</p>
<p>it is all about the people.</p>
<p>Yeah, no, I agree.</p>
<p>So, Cameron, thank you for making my 100th</p>
<p>episode enjoyable.</p>
<p>I'm honored.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
